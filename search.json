    "text": "What is a VAVP?\nVirtual prototyping is obviously not a new idea. For visual design and general engineering well developed tools have been around for many decades (for example, see the plethor of CAD and FE packages) and their use is standard practice within industry, allowing engineers to inspect designs and even evaluate their funcational performance prior to manufacturing. Extending the virtual prototype concept to the realms of vibro-acoustics one arrives at the aptly named Vibro-Acoustic Virtual Prototype (VAVP). An early definition of a VAVP is given by Moorhouse as ‘a computer representation of a machine, e.g. a washing machine, fridge, lawnmower etc., such that its sound can be heard without it necessarily having to exist as a physical machine’. Outlined more a little more explicitly, a VAVP is a virtual assembly that is built from the properties of its constituent components in such a way that best represents the physical workings and/or vibro-acoustic ‘appearance’ of the real machine and, furthermore, can be used to produce operational response preidctions, including auralisations, of said machine. Here, the term ‘auralisation’ may be defined as the creation and subsequent presentation of audible sound  files generated from numerical (simulated, measured, or synthesized) data.\nIn short, a Vibro-Acoustic Virtual Prototype is a digital representation of an assembly that is able reproduce its operational vibro-acoustic response with a sufficient degree of accuracy to be used as a design tool.",

    "text": "Why use a VAVP?\nBefore we describe the key components of Vibro-Acoustic Virtual Prototype, it is worth taking a brief aside to discus the importance of Vibro-Acoustic design and, in doing so, justify the not insignificant effort required to actually build a VAVP!\nVibro-acoustic design was once something of an afterthought. In recent decades it hss steadily been increasing in importance. Nowhere is this trend more evident than in the automotive industry where vehicle attributes relating to Noise Vibration and Harshness (NVH) are nowadays often given the highest priority. There are complex reasons for this growth in status but in general it all comes back to two major drivers: legislation and customer perception.\nRegarding legislation, manufacturers of many products, vehicles, industrial, domestic and outdoor products for example, are typically subject to mandatory limits on noise or vibration emission. In the European Union for example certain types of equipment may not be sold unless they meet limits for sound power.\nCustomer perception, on the other hand, is typically a more complex issue that may take several forms, the most important of which is ‘brand image’. The iconic ‘potato-potato-potato’ sound of the Harley Davidson engine and the satisfying ‘clunk’ of the VW car door are classic examples where sounds have augmented brand value by making a product more desirable. Product sounds may also attract negative associations though which can be damaging to the brand, for example if a product sounds ‘cheap’ or ‘nasty’.\nTo satisfy legislation or customer preference, manufacturers have adopted a range of specific vibro-acoustic design targets. Those derived from legislation are for the most part single number limits designed for simplicity and clarity. Targets for customer perception on the other hand, are a far more nuanced and complex matter. What makes a product sound ‘cool’ or ‘tinny’ or ‘wrong’? To understand how positive or negative associations are triggered by combinations of features in the sound it is necessary to dive into the field psycho-acoustics. Even with an understanding of what makes a product sound ‘cool’, engineers are set the daunting task of designing the product to acheive the cool sound. How engineering modifications map to specific features in the sound and then to perception is a complex question, making the `sound design’ of engineered products far more difficult and advanced problem than traditional noise control typically used for meeting legislative requirements.\nIt is clear that manufacturers cannot afford to get the vibro-acoustic design wrong and furthermore that getting it right may demand a sophisticated, possibly multidisciplinary approach. The task is made all the more difficult by constant pressure to reduce mass and cost.\nThe need for ‘vibro-acoustic virtual prototypes’ has emerged from the desire to evaluate and/or listen to designs or design modifications before the machines physically exist. Traditionally, this task would involve extensive phyiscal prototyping and testing, iterating towards a final design. Clearly, this is a slow and expensive process. With their ability to reduce cost, accelerate time to market, and optimize products to higher levels of performance and reliability, virtual prototyping methods are considered the most suitable alternative, particularly with regards to the assessment of vibro-acoustic performance and the drive towards net-zero.\nTo provide the above benifits, a VAVP should be able to: a) predict the total vibro-acoustic response of an assembly (as a spectra or auralisation) with sufficient accuracy to be of practical use within a product development context, and b) evaluate the effect of modifying or replacing components for the purposes of design optimisation. This implies that our VAVP is built from components, and defined in such a way that they can be removed and replaced independently of the assembly and other connected components.\nThe above should seem like a pretty attractive and obvious approach to product design… Then why is Vibro-Acoustic Virtual Prototyping so far behind its visual and mechanical counterparts? The need for VAVP to produce realistic sounds raises immense scientific and technical challenges. In part, these are due to the complexity of the machines being represented and in part because, in striving for realism, we are up against a formidable opponent - the extraordinary sophistication of human hearing!\nConsider a comparatively simple vibro-acoustic assembly as an example - a music box attached to a sounding board. From the sound of the assembled unit the average person is able to discern fine detail in the active mechanism itself and also certain properties of the (passive) sounding board, whether it is wood or metal for example. To produce a VAVP of this relatively simple system then, we need not only to model the active mechanism in significant detail but also the passive support structure. Neither component can be omitted. When we scale up this example to a complex machine like a vehicle there may be multiple active components and hundereds of passive components involved in the transmission path to the ear of the listener, none of which can necessarily be neglected a priori.\nHuman ability to discern fine detail in sound as mentioned above is related to the impressive frequency range over which our hearing system operates. Adults are normally able to hear up to at least 10 kHz and nowadays specifications for electric vehicles often extend to the very top of this range. At the other end of the scale, most people can hear down to 20 Hz and if we include tactile vibration in our VAVP then we may need to model down to 1 Hz. Thus, the full working range of a VAVP could span four whole orders of magnitude (a factor of 10000!).\nThe range of structural and acoustic wavelengths corresponding to this frequency range is also very wide, usually extending from larger than the whole machine to smaller than individual components. As a consequence, no one method of modelling is capable of spanning the whole frequency range. As such the VAVP should be able to mix-and-match different measurement and modelling schemes to best represent the assembled system (so-called hybrid modelling).\nAnother major challenge is the modeling of vibration-generating mechanisms found inside every active component - fluctuating forces brought about by various mechanisms including aero- and fluid-dynamic forces, magnetic forces, impacts, friction forces, gear transmission error, forces at joints etc. These mechanisms tend to be highly complex, the inputs are often difficult to determine and the mechanisms themselves are often nonlinear, all of which makes modeling challenging. Perhaps for these reasons, while enormous effort has been devoted to vibro-acoustic modeling over the last few decades, only a tiny fraction of this effort has been directed towards source mechanisms. As a result the vast majority of models tell us how a structure responds to unit force input but do not attempt to ‘switch on’ the machine with realistic input. Today then, reliable models of vibro-acoustic sources must be considered beyond state-of-the-art.\nSo then, the potential benifits of VAVPs are quite evident, as are the challenges we face in their construction. How then do we go about building one?",

    "section": "How to build a VAVP",
    "text": "How to build a VAVP\nWhen considering the role of VAVPs, it is worthwhile to consider the steps in the process of using physical prototypes for vibro-acoustic design. Broadly speaking: 1) the (physical) components are constructed, then 2) connected together to form the assembly. 3) any active elements or sources are then switched on and 4) the vibro-acoustic outputs are monitored and compared with targets (potentially including perceptual targets). If design optimisation is required then 5) components are modified or replaced and we then repeat steps 3) and 4).\nThe same basic elements will be required for a virtual prototype except that all physical aspects are replaced by digital representations. Thus, the VAVP is expected to include the following elements:\n\npassive and active components\nmeans of assembly\nprediction of output including by auralisation\nmeans of replacing components.\n\nIn what follows we will lay out the basic conceptual scheme together with the main assumptions to be used in the component-based approach for VAVPs. The general principles are illustrated in Figure 1, though before we can discuss this in more detail it will be useful to describe more generally: the component-based approach to VAVPs, black box modelling, and the types of components encountered in most VAVPs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVAVP representation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the VAVP framework. The physical assembly is excited by internal mechanisms within the source; the resulting vibration propagates through the coupled assembly, passing through the interface DoFs \\(c\\). The VAVP representation couples together the source and receiver components by substructuring, before representing the internal forcing by an equivalent blocked force applied to the coupling interface.\n\n\n\n\nComponent-based approach\nAn important aspect of physical prototypes is the ability to remove, replace and transfer components from one assembly to another. Provided the fixing locations are compatible between the components and the rest of the assembly (i.e. the bolt holes line up) then we expect to be able to interchange (physical) components with complete freedom.\nInterchangeability is equally important in the virtual domain with a VAVP and the term ‘component-based’ has been coined to indicate just this: the component-based approach then can be defined as one in which all (virtual) components are separable, interchangeable, transferable or independent (of the assembly) - all these terms will be considered as equivalent in this context. We might also talk of component properties or intrinsic properties, meaning that they belong to the component alone and are free from any influence of the rest of the assembly. The terms component-based simulation and VAVP will similarly be assumed equivalent.\nWhen representing components with measured data however we cannot take for granted that this all-important interchangeability will be achieved, in fact, in general this will not be the case unless specific measures are adopted. In essence in the component-based approach, components must be characterised in a state with the interfaces either free or rigidly fixed. The precise form of characterisation will depend on the type of component considered, but will typically constitute a so-called black box representation.\n\n\nBlack-box models\nIn a typical VAVP, each individual component is represented by a black box model. The concept of a black box model is incredibly general, though its origins come from electric network analysis where it states that an electrical system is fully described by the behavior at its terminals; the particulars of what goes on inside the box are unknown and of no great importance. In other words in a black box, the inputs and outputs are related in a known and defined way but the workings in between are unknown.\nIn the case of vibro-acoustics, the ‘systems’ to be described by black boxes are the components of the VAVP. But what constitutes the ‘terminals’ of these black boxes? Generally, we need to consider ‘interfaces’ and ‘remote’, specifically ‘target’, points. Clearly, we need to capture all inputs (normally forces) and outputs (normally vibration or acoustic responses) to and from the component. Interfaces, as the regions where a component connects to another component, are where this transmission takes place and so all interface points must be included in our black box description. Additionally, we may be interested in the response at target locations; for example, the acoustic response at a driver’s ear position might be needed even if no external forces are applied there.\nNote that this is quite different to what we are used to when modelling components, for example using the Finite Element method. In this case,the structural dynamic properties at every point of the structure are determined, only limited by the resolution of the mesh employed. A description based on measurements on the other hand will typically only include the properties at the interfaces and target locations; no information is available regarding what goes on in between the inputs and outputs unless we specifically define a response location there.\nIn electrical networks, black boxes are defined so that they can be connected to form larger networks by applying coupling rules. The same is true of the black box components defined for a VAVP which can be connected to form larger assemblies using substructuring techniques.\n\n\nComponents\nComponents are any parts of the assembly that one may need to separate from the whole, for example to allow components from different manufacturers to be modified or replaced. It should be clear from the above that a component is the fundamental unit of the VAVP that is not further divisible without taking further measurements (in which case the components would be redefined).\nUsually, a component of a VAVP coincides with a physically separable component, but this is not necessarily the case. In fact, in the virtual world there is considerable flexibility in defining the boundaries.\nThe first step in constructing a VAVP then is to define the components. In effect, since a black box is fully defined by the way it responds with the outside world, this means defining their boundaries, and in particular their interfaces, i.e. the regions of the boundary where they connect to neighboring components in the VAVP. We also need to include any other points where the response needs to be known such as target locations. The component is therefore defined solely at the interfaces and target points. But what properties are needed to define the component at these points? This depends on whether the component is active or passive.\nPassive components are ones that transmit and/or radiate energy, but do not contain any vibration generating mechanisms. Passive components include vibration isolators, frames, body panels, cavities, etc. To characterise a passive component we require a measure of its ability to accept and transmit vibrational energy. This can be achieved in a variety of ways, though not all are appropriate for building a VAVP. The characterisation of passive components will be discussed in more detail in Components and Vibration Isolators but for now it is enough to say that they can be characterised by a set of frequency response functions (FRFs, frequency dependent filters) defined at and between all interface connections and target locations. These FRFs are stored as in matrix form. The choice of FRFs as our component representation will be justified later. As described above, the notion of independence and transferability is central to the VAVP approach. Hence, these FRFs must be obtained with the component held under appropriate boundary conditions, specifically we require the components free or fixed interface FRFs matrices.\nActive components are ones that contain vibration generating mechanisms. Obvious examples include motors, pumps, gear boxes, engines, etc. For some problems the source definition is perhaps not so obvious. For example, considering the problem of ground induced building vibration, the active component would be the earth..! Like passive components, active components are characterised by their ability to accept and transmit vibrational energy, i.e. their free or fixed interface FRFs. Though, these passive properties are not enough. A secondary quantity is required to describe the component’s operational activity, i.e. the vibration generated by the internal mechanisms. Like the required FRFs, an active descriptor should also be an independent and transferable property. It has become standard practice to use the so-called Blocked force.\n\n\nInterfaces\nBefore a component can be characterised (whether active or passive) it is necessary choose an interface representation. That is, means of describing the physical interface by a finite set of FRFs. In fact, this perhaps the most crucial step in the development of a VAVP; it is often said that *everything goes right or wrong at the interface!\nInterfaces can be defined as those regions of the boundary where a component connects to other components. Determining where there is contact between two components is normally relatively straightforward, but defining the interface representation requires that all dynamic forces are properly accounted for. This a significantly more difficult task that it sounds for two main reasons.\nFirst, dynamic forces do not only act perpendicular to the boundary but may occur simultaneously in different directions or degrees of freedom (DoF). In general, at a single point up to six DoF are required for a full description, three perpendicular forces and three moments (rotational forces) about perpendicular axes. Thus, even a single point interface may require up to six DoF and a 6x6 matrix of FRFs. Failure to include the important DoF can amount to a disastrous misrepresentation. However, successful characterisation is not simply a question of ‘playing safe’ and including all six DoF every time since not all DoFs are important on every occasion; including of inactive DoFs can can to increase experimental error and uncertainty. Defining an interface therefore requires a thorough understanding of the dynamics of the specific interface in question and often requires preliminary testing of some form.\nSecondly, there is the question of how to represent a contact patch by discreet points. Real connections are extended in the sense that contact is made over a surface area. However, the FRFs used to characterise components are point-to-point quantities… How then do we describe continuous contact? The conventional approach is to assume a point like connection; this is a valid assumption when the structural wavelength is much greater than the nominal dimensions of the interface connection. A point-like connection is described by 6 ‘rigid body’ DoFs; 3 translations in \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\), and a rotational about each axis \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\). The challenge is then how to take a set of measured FRFs and transform these into the 6 rigid body DoFs… Moreover, when this point-like assumption breaks down (i.e. when the structural wavelength becomes comparable in size to the interface) some other form of discretisation is required that captures the ‘flexible dynamics’ over an extended interface. In Interfaces we will introduce some common methods used to represent point-like and flexible interfaces in the context of VAVPs.\n\n\nVAVP framework and key equations\nTo summarise so far, a VAVP is a digital representation of a machine whose components can be interchanged and modified and which sounds and feels just like the real thing. To achieve this we have seen we will need to include model representations of both active components, which generate the initial disturbance, and passive components which transmit vibration and/or radiate the sound. All components must be represented independently so that they can be built into an assembly and interchanged at will.\nThe VAVP scheme is a highly flexible and general framework that applies to a very broad range of assemblies including machines, vehicles, ships, buildings, any system effectively that is approximately linear and time-invariant. Moreover, provided the requirements for the component-based approach are met, both modelled and measured data can in theory be combined within the same framework. Given that modelling alone is not yet able to deliver the virtual prototypes that industry demands, the ability to hybridise data in this way within a single self-consistent framework is potentially highly significant.\nShown on the left-hand side of Figure 1 is a simple arrangement with two components, an active source and a passive receiver. The source \\(S\\) is excited by some internal dynamic forces which are assumed not to be accessible for direct measurement. The receiver \\(R\\) contains no such forces but is excited through the interface \\(c\\), causing a response at \\(r\\). On the right-hand side of Figure 1 is the corresponding VAVP representation. In the VAVP representation the assembly is built by coupling together the source and receiver component FRFs using a technique termed substructuring. Once couples, the internal forces within the source are represented equivalently using the previously mentioned blocked forces applied to the coupling interface. In theory, this combination should give an identical response as obtained from the physical assembly. Of course, this is never quite the case in reality..!\nTo summarise the process of building a VAVP, we have the following key steps:\n\nCharacterise passive properties\nCharacterise active properties\nCouple components\nMake response prediction and auralise.\n\nTo provide some context for coming sections, we provide a brief description of each of the above steps. More detail will be provided though the comming sections.\n\nStep 1. Characterise passive properties\nAs discussed above, passive properties of each component are represented by FRF matrices, e.g.  \\[\n    \\mathbf{Y}_{S}(\\omega), \\quad \\mathbf{Y}_{R}(\\omega)\n\\]\\end{equation}$$ where, \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) indicates a matrix of structural (mobility) FRFs, the upper case subscript denoting the component to which the quantity belongs.\n\n\nStep 2. Characterise active components\nFor sources we require a measure of their activity in addition to their passive properties (\\(\\mathbf{Y}_S\\)). Here we quantify activity in terms of blocked forces, which are obtained by solving a so-called inverse problem. The main equation for obtaining blocked forces is, \\[\n    \\mathbf{v}_c = \\mathbf{Y}_{Ccc} \\mathbf{\\bar{f}}_{c}    \n\\tag{1}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{\\bar{f}}_{c}\\) is a vector of blocked forces with one entry for every DoF on the interface: the subscript \\(c\\) indicates that it applies on the interface labeled \\(c\\). \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Ccc}\\) is the matrix of FRFs for the coupled (\\(C\\)) source and receiver assembly. The first lower case \\(c\\) indicates the set of response (output) points and the second the set of excitation points which in this formulation are co-located on interface \\(c\\). \\(\\mathbf{v}_c\\) represents the vector of operational responses, again with one entry for every point on interface \\(c\\).\nSolving Equation 1 requires separate tests, a passive system identification test to obtain the FRF matrix \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Ccc}\\) and an operational test with the machine running to obtain \\(\\mathbf{v}_c\\). Having obtained the data for \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Ccc}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_c\\), one then solves Equation 1 to obtain the unknown blocked forces. This step is known as solving the inverse problem. It is not intuitively obvious why these forces are termed ‘blocked forces’; this will be addressed later in Blocked forces. Obtaining blocked forces, including solving the inverse problem, is one of the most critical stages in building a VAVP.\n\n\nStep 3. Couple components\nHaving obtained FRF data describing each component in Step 1, they need to be coupled together to build a model of the virtual assembly. The rules for coupling are well known; one simply needs to satisfy continuity and equilibrium conditions across the connecting interfaces, a process which has become known as frequency-domain substructuring. There are numerous formulations of substructuring, some of which we describe in Substructuring. For now, without making a preference at this stage, we will simply indicate the coupling step as: \\[\n    \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{Y}_{X} \\\\ \\mathbf{H}_{X} \\end{array} \\right] = DS(\\mathbf{Y}_{S},\\mathbf{Y}_{R},\\mathbf{H}_R),\n\\tag{2}\\] in which \\(DS(\\square)\\) indicates any formulation of dynamic substructuring, that is combining the properties of the sources \\(S\\) and receivers \\(R\\) on the right hand side to form the FRFs of the virtual assembly \\(X\\). In the above \\(\\mathbf{H}_R\\) and \\(\\mathbf{H}_X\\) are vibro-acoustic FRF matrices fo the receiver and coupled assembly respectively. They enable the prediction of a acoustic responses (sound pressures) within the receiver component.\n\n\nStep 4. Forward prediction and auralisation\nHaving built the assembly (\\(\\mathbf{Y}_X\\)) in Step 3, the machine must then be ‘switched on’ so that the resulting sound and vibration can be simulated. The switching on is done by applying the blocked forces (\\(\\mathbf{\\bar{f}}\\)) obtained in Step 2 to the assembly built in Step 3. The acoustic or vibration response at target locations is then given by, \\[\n    \\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n        \\mathbf{v}_{r} \\\\\n        \\mathbf{p}_{r}\n    \\end{array}\\right) = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc} \\mathbf{Y}_{Xrc} \\\\ \\mathbf{H}_{Xrc} \\end{array} \\right]  \\mathbf{\\bar{f}}_{c}\n\\tag{3}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{v}_{r}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{p}_{r_2}\\) are the structural and acoustic responses at the target DoFs \\(r\\), \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Crc}\\) is the structural FRF matrix for excitation at locations on interface \\(c\\) and structural response at \\(r\\) and \\(\\mathbf{H}_{Cr_2c}\\) is the vibro-acoustic FRF connecting acoustic responses at \\(r\\) to force excitation at interface \\(c\\). \\(\\mathbf{\\bar{f}}_{c}\\) is the blocked force vector at interface \\(c\\) as obtained in Step 2.",

If you would like more detail on any of the topics discussed, this book would be a good place to start. Some more topic specific references will be given where necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the VAVP concept. An active vibration source (left component) is coupled to a passive receiver component (right). Source activity due to internal mechanisms (e.g. gear meshing) are represented using concept of equivalent blocked forces. The source and receiver components are coupled together by satisfying equilibrium and compatibility between connecting interfaces, a process terms substructuring. When combined, these methods enable us to predict the assembly’s operational response.\n\n\n\nTo help navigate this page and find what you are looking for, here is a brief summary of each introduction:\n\nVibro-Acoustic Virtual Prototyping - We introduce the concept of virtual prototyping for vibro-acoustic design and describe at a high level the adopted framework.\nComponents - The VAVP framework is built on the notion of component-level characterisation. In this introduction we discuss some of the particulars of component characterisation, with a focus on passive properties.\nInterfaces - Within the VAVP framework, components are characterised predominantly by their interface dynamics. To substructure an assembly together it is essential that the component’s interfaces are appropriately represented. We will discuss various interface representations that can be used within the VAVP framework.\nVibration isolators - Very rarely are vibration sources attached directly to their assemblies. More often, resilient elements, or vibration isolators, are used as an intermediate component to help mitigate the transmission of vibration. We discuss their characterisation for use within the VAVP framework.\nSubstructuring - Once all the components in the assembly have been characterised, it is necessary to assemble them to form a model of the coupled system. This assembly process is termed substructuring.\nBlocked force - Central to the VAVP framework is the ability to `turn on’ a model to predict an operational response. This requires a description of the active behaviour of any connected vibration sources. This is achieved using the concept of blocked forces.\nUncertainties - It is fair to argue that the output of a model is meaningless without some estimate of its uncertainty. The same goes for a VAVP. We discuss some methods for quantifying and propagating uncertainty within the VAVP framework.\n\nFor more recent developments related to VAVPs and TPA (at least ones that I am involved with) see my recent papers.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nMeggitt, JWR, and AT Moorhouse. 2025.

The complete and independent characterisation of a coupling element is provided by its free-interface FRF matrix, \\[\n    \\mathbf{Y}_{I} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \\mathbf{Y}_{I{c_1c_1}} & \\mathbf{Y}_{I{c_1c_2}} \\\\\n        \\mathbf{Y}_{I{c_2c_1}} & \\mathbf{Y}_{I{c_2c_2}}  \\end{array}\\right]\n\\] where \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) represent the DoFs at the two ends of the element, and the subscript \\(I\\) that the coupling element is in isolation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOften when dealing with vibration isolators, or more presicely, vibration isolated systems, we talk of transmissibility as a means of characterisation. Whilst transmissibility provides a convenient means of assessing the performance of an isolation system, it is important to note that it is not an independent property of the isolator itself but includes properties of the isolated component. A change in the mass of this component will lead to a change in the transmissibility. Whats more, hwils the transmissibility is indeed a type of FRF (i.e. an input output relation), it is defined between two like quantities, for example force input to force output (or motion input to motion output). Hence, it does not contain sufficient information to allow for structural coupling, and is therefor of no use within the VAVP framework.\n\n\nAs mentioned on the previous page, for coupling elements free-interface FRFs are challenging to measure, and not necessarily representative. For this reason, a much greater emphasis has been placed on their so-called fixed-interface dynamics. Indeed, historically the preferred quantity to characterise a resilient element has been the dynamic transfer stiffness (recall that dynamic stiffness, like impedance and effective mass, has a kinematic constraint in its defintion), denoted \\(\\mathbf{D}_{I{ij}}\\) (or \\(\\mathbf{D}_{I{ji}}\\)), which describes the relation between an applied displacement at one side of the element to the resultant blocked force at the other, \\[\n    \\mathbf{\\bar{f}}_{i} = \\mathbf{D}_{Iij} \\mathbf{x}_{j} {\\big{|}_{\\mathbf{x}_i=0,  i\\neq j}}.\n\\] The term dynamic indicates that, in contrast to static stiffness which is constant, the dynamic stiffness is frequency-dependent and indeed for isolators, often displays significant variation with frequency. In addition, isolator properties may be sensitive to static pre-load, dynamic excitation level, temperature and relative humidity. These non-linearities make the complete characterisation of a resilient element a complicated and involved task. Nevertheless, for most practical situations (excluding extreme environmental conditions) a reasonable characterisation can be obtained by considering an element’s linear (small excitation) behaviour under an appropriate pre-load and at a given temperature.\nAssuming a single point-like connection at each end (thus excluding distributed elements such as resilient matting), the point and transfer impedances of a coupling element are completely described by \\(6\\times 6\\) matrices of the form, \\[\\label{}\n    \\mathbf{Z}_{I{c_ic_j}} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cccccc} Z_{I{x_ix_j}} & Z_{I{x_iy_j}} & Z_{I{x_iz_j}} & Z_{I{x_i\\alpha_j}} & Z_{I{x_i\\beta_j}} & Z_{I{x_i\\gamma_j}} \\\\\n        Z_{I{y_ix_j}} & Z_{I{y_iy_j}} & Z_{I{y_iz_j}} & Z_{I{y_i\\alpha_j}} & Z_{I{y_i\\beta_j}} & Z_{I{y_i\\gamma_j}} \\\\\n        Z_{I{z_ix_j}} & Z_{I{z_iy_j}} & Z_{I{z_iz_j}} & Z_{I{z_i\\alpha_j}} & Z_{I{z_i\\beta_j}} & Z_{I{z_i\\gamma_j}} \\\\\n        Z_{I{\\alpha_i x_j}} & Z_{I{\\alpha_i y_j}} & Z_{I{\\alpha_i z_j}} & Z_{I{\\alpha_i\\alpha_j}} & Z_{I{\\alpha_i\\beta_j}} & Z_{I{\\alpha_i\\gamma_j}} \\\\\n        Z_{I{\\beta_i x_j}} & Z_{I{\\beta_i y_j}} & Z_{I{\\beta_i z_j}} & Z_{I{\\beta_i\\alpha_j}} & Z_{I{\\beta_i\\beta_j}} & Z_{I{\\beta_i\\gamma_j}}\\\\\n        Z_{I{\\gamma_i x_j}} & Z_{I{\\gamma_i y_j}} & Z_{I{\\gamma_i z_j}} & Z_{I{\\gamma_i\\alpha_j}} & Z_{I{\\gamma_i\\beta_j}} & Z_{I{\\gamma_i\\gamma_j}}\n    \\end{array}\\right],\n\\] where, for example, \\(Z_{I{z_i\\beta_j}}\\) represents the transfer impedance relating an applied angular velocity about the \\({y}\\) axes at interface \\(j\\), to the resultant translational blocked force in the \\({z}\\) direction at interface \\(i\\). The complete isolator impedance matrix \\(\\mathbf{Z}_{I}\\) is thus \\(12\\times 12\\).\nWith regards to characterisation methods for resilient elements, broadly speaking, they can be categorised as either experimental or model-based, with the former being further categorised as either direct or indirect. Direct methods involve the direct measurement of force for the transfer impedance, whereas with indirect methods these quantities are inferred from other, usually more easily measured quantities. Model-based methods typically involve establishing a numerical or analytical model that describes the underlying physics of the element, followed by a model updating procedure to determine the model inputs. Here, are focus is on experimental methods.\n\nBlocking mass methods\nBefore introducing the in situ method of isolator characterisation it is worth breifly describing the more classical approaches described in ISO 10846. Both methods rely on the use of a blocking mass to physically enforce the kinematic constraint in the defintiion of transfer stiffness/impedance. The so-called direct method (ISO 10846-2) approximates the blocking force by installing a force transducer between the coupling element and the blocking mass. The in-direct method (ISO 10846-3) infers this force from the mass of the blocking mass \\(m\\), and its acceleration \\(a\\) using Newton’s 2nd law, \\(F=ma\\).\nThough standardised, these blocking mass methods are not well suited to the needs of a VAVP. First of all, they are rather impractical. The blocking masses are typically many hundereds of kg making the expeirmental set-up quite substantial. Secondly, to charactrise an element in multiple DoFs (often required for a VAVP), multiple different test configurations are required. This makes the complete characterrisation of an element increidbly time consuming. Thirdly, the use of blocking mass tends to limit the frequency range of applicability. And fourthly, the blocking mass methods are only designed to provie transfer characteristics. The full characterisation of an element requires also a characterisation of the point dynamics are either end. All of these limitations are overcome by the in situ method described below.",

    "text": "In situ method (inverse substructuring)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of coupled \\(AIB\\) assembly.\n\n\n\n\nThe blocking mass methods described above determine the transfer impedance elements \\(Z_{ij}\\) of a resilient element by physically constraining one end with a blocking mass. In-situ methods achieve these same constraints, instead, by mathematical means. As well as avoiding the need for a blocking mass this opens up the potential for characterising elements while in real installations which by definition provides realistic operating conditions such as pre-load.\nThe in-situ characterisation of a resilient element involves the extraction of invariant component properties from measurements made on a coupled assembly, i.e. with the element installed between two arbitrary components, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) (Figure 1). To see how this is possible we construct the impedance matrix for an AIB assembly, i.e. an isolator \\(I\\) between substructures \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), noting that the impedance matrix of the assembly is given by the sum of those of the individual substructures (see Substructuring for more details on impedance coupling): \\[\n\\mathbf{Z}_{Ccc}  = \\mathbf{Z}_{Acc} + \\mathbf{Z}_{Icc} +   \\mathbf{Z}_{Bcc}\n\\] or when written out in expanded form, \\[\n\\left[ \\begin{array}{cc}\n\\mathbf{Z}_{Cc_1c_1} & \\mathbf{Z}_{Cc_1c_2} \\\\\n\\mathbf{Z}_{Cc_2c_1} & \\mathbf{Z}_{Cc_2c_2} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right]\n=\n\\left[ \\begin{array}{cc}\n\\mathbf{Z}_{Ac_1c_1} & \\mathbf{0} \\\\\n\\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{0}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n+\n\\left[ \\begin{array}{cc}\n\\mathbf{Z}_{Ic_1c_1} & \\mathbf{Z}_{Ic_1c_2} \\\\\n\\mathbf{Z}_{Ic_2c_1} & \\mathbf{Z}_{Ic_2c_2} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right]\n+\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{0} \\\\\n\\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{Z}_{Bc_2c_2}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\tag{1}\\] where as usual \\(C\\) represents assembly properties and \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(I\\) those of the substructures. Rewriting gives, \\[\n\\mathbf{Z}_{Ccc} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\mathbf{Z}_{Ac_1c_1} + \\mathbf{Z}_{Ic_1c_1} & \\mathbf{Z}_{Ic_1c_2} \\\\\n\\mathbf{Z}_{Ic_2c_1} & \\mathbf{Z}_{Bc_2c_2} + \\mathbf{Z}_{Ic_2c_2}\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\mathbf{Y}_{Ccc}^{-1}\n\\tag{2}\\] where it is recalled that the impedance matrix \\(\\mathbf{Z}_{Ccc}\\) is simply the inverse of the FRF matrix \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Ccc}\\).\nThe remarkable conclusion from Equation 2 is that the off-diagonal elements of the assembly’s impedance matrix, obtained by inverting the measurable coupled FRF, are identically equal to those of the isolator alone (\\(\\mathbf{Z}_{Ic_2c_1}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{Z}_{Ic_1c_2}\\)) and completely independent of the connected substructures \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\nThis important result can be explained from the definition of impedance: for the transfer impedance \\(\\mathbf{Z}_{Ic_2c_1}\\), the blocking force constraint at \\(c_2\\) in the definition of impedance essentially removes the dynamic influence of component \\(B\\), whilst at the same time, the velocity at \\(c_1\\) is applied irrespective of the dynamics of \\(A\\), and so neither \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) contribute to \\(\\mathbf{Z}_{Ic_2c_1}\\). Obviously, a similar argument applies in the other direction.\nAn important consequence of Equation 2 is that it provides a means of independently characterising a coupling element in situ, i.e. whilst installed within an arbitrary assembly. Furthermore, recalling that the interface DoFs \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) are assumed to include all 6 pont-like DoFs (i.e. three translations and three rotations), the transfer impedance \\(\\mathbf{Z}_{Ic_1c_2}\\), by definition, constrains all the DoFs included in \\(\\mathbf{Y}_C\\). This enables the simultaneous characterisation of both in-plane and rotational transfer impedance terms. In essence, the act of numerically inverting the FRF matrix \\(\\mathbf{Y}_C\\) constrains all the DoFs that are included within it. If a particular DoF is omitted, it will not be constrained by the matrix inversion, and so the resulting impedance terms will not be subject to the correct set of constraints.\nIn summary, the in-situ characterisation of a resilient element is performed as follows:\n\nInstall the element within a representative assembly. This might be a bespoke test rig that applies an appropriate pre-load, or an actual installation.\nInstrument the interfaces above and below the isolator such that the DoFs of interest can be resolved.\nMeasure the coupled mobility by exciting above and below the element, and recording their simultaneous responses.\nApply appropriate interface transformation to obtain \\(\\mathbf{Y}_C\\) and invert numerically.\nExtract the off-diagonal transfer impedance \\(\\mathbf{Z}_{Ic_1c_2}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{Z}_{Ic_2c_1}\\), which independently characterises the element \\(I\\).\n\nIt is important to note that the in-situ method, like the blocking mass methods described above, provides an estimate of only the transfer impedance, and that a complete characterisation also requires the point impedance matrices \\(\\mathbf{Z}_{Ic_1c_1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Z}_{Ic_2c_2}\\) to be known. As shown in Equation 2, the point impedance determined by the above procedure is that of the coupled \\(AI\\) or \\(IB\\) assemblies so a full characterisation cannot be obtained from in situ measurements alone. Methods to estimate the missing point impedances are presented below.",

For two sub-structures in rigid contact at a single point it may be expressed in the form, \\[\ng_1 = -g_2\n\\] where \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) represent the interface coupling forces at the connecting DoFs of the two sub-structures.\nThe condition of continuity (also known as compatibility) states that the sub-structural DoFs in rigid contact must move in unison, i.e. with equal velocity (also displacement and acceleration), and may be expressed in the form, \\[\nv_1 = v_2 = v_C\n\\] where \\(v_1\\) and \\(v_2\\) represent the contact velocities of the two sub-structures, and \\(v_C\\) the velocity of the coupled structure.\nIn the presence of several sub-structures and/or connecting DoFs, the above conditions can be expressed more generally in vector form as, \\[\n\\mathbf{g}_1 = -\\mathbf{g}_2\n\\tag{1}\\] and \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{v}_C\n\\tag{2}\\] where Equation 1 and Equation 2 are now generalised in the sense that they can also include moment forces and angular responses, respectively.\nDynamic substructuring, the process of assembling substructural properties to form an assembly, amounts to the application of the above conditions to the connecting interfaces between each substructure (or equivalently, component). Depending on how these substructures are represented (i.e. in the physical domain, modal domain, frequency domain, or state-space) the sub-structuring formulation may differ, though the underlying physics remains the same.\nIn this book we are principally focused on frequency domain methods, and so we will consider sub-structuring methods. That said, the sub-structuring methods presented below are not limited to experimental FRFs. FRF matrices determined by analytical or numerical means can also be used to represent individual sub-structures.

Each substructure is characterised independently by their free interface mobility matrices, \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Scc}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N_c\\times N_c}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N_c\\times N_c}\\).

Our treatment of the direct method will be brief as the primal and dual methods provide far more flexible substructuring frameworks. Indeed, our focus here will simply be to prove the impedance coupling relation used in Isolators for the in situ characterisation of coupling element, i.e. \\[\n\\mathbf{Z}_{Ccc}  = \\mathbf{Z}_{Acc} + \\mathbf{Z}_{Icc} +   \\mathbf{Z}_{Bcc}\n\\tag{3}\\] which states that when two structures are in rigid contact, their impedance matrices sum together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of example source-receiver (\\(SR\\)) assembyly (shown uncoupled). Interface DoFs are denoted \\(c\\) and remote points \\(r\\).\n\n\n\nTo derive Equation 3 we begin with the interface responses of the (uncoupled) substructures \\(S\\) and \\(R\\) due to an interface forcing, \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_{Sc} = \\mathbf{Y}_{Scc} \\left(\\mathbf{f}_{Sc}+\\mathbf{g}_{Sc}\\right), \\quad \\mathbf{v}_{Rc} = \\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc} \\left(\\mathbf{f}_{Rc}+\\mathbf{g}_{Rc}\\right)\n\\] where \\(\\mathbf{f}\\) represents an externally applied force, and \\(\\mathbf{g}\\) a set of interface (coupling) forces.\nWe assume the inverse matrices \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Scc}^{-1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc}^{-1}\\) exist, and rearrange the above equations to isolate the interface forces, \\[\n\\mathbf{Y}_{Scc}^{-1}\\mathbf{v}_{Sc} - \\mathbf{f}_{Sc} = \\mathbf{g}_{Sc}, \\quad \\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc}^{-1}\\mathbf{v}_{Rc} - \\mathbf{f}_{Rc} = \\mathbf{g}_{Rc}.\n\\] Equilibrium and continuity are then enforced as per Equation 1 and ?@eq-eq-contin, \\[\n\\mathbf{Y}_{Scc}^{-1}\\mathbf{v}_{c} - \\mathbf{f}_{Sc} = -\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc}^{-1}\\mathbf{v}_{c} + \\mathbf{f}_{Rc}\n\\] where it is noted that the coupled response \\(\\mathbf{v}_{c}\\) has been substituted for both the source and receiver velocities.\nIsolating the external force terms and introducing the coupled external force \\(\\mathbf{f}_{c} = \\mathbf{f}_{Rc} + \\mathbf{f}_{Sc}\\) as the sum of substructure external forces yields, \\[\n\\left(\\mathbf{Y}_{Scc}^{-1}+\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc}^{-1}\\right)\\mathbf{v}_{c} = \\mathbf{f}_{c}.\n\\] Finally, pre-multiplying both sides by the inverse of the left bracketed term (assuming its exists), we obtain an expression for the coupled velocity, \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_{c} = \\left(\\mathbf{Y}_{Scc}^{-1}+\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc}^{-1}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{f}_{c}.\n\\tag{4}\\] Equation 4 relates an external force applied to the interface DoFs \\(c\\) to the coupled velocity at said DoFs. Hence, the bracketed term must represent the point mobility matrix of the coupled assembly’s interface,\n\\[\n\\mathbf{Y}_{Ccc} = \\left(\\mathbf{Y}_{Scc}^{-1}+\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc}^{-1}\\right)^{-1}.\n\\tag{5}\\] Recalling that the inverse of mobility is impedance, from Equation 5 we see that the coupled impedance may be expressed simply as the sum of sub-structure impedances, \\[\\label{}\n\\mathbf{Z}_{Ccc} = \\mathbf{Z}_{Scc}+\\mathbf{Z}_{Rcc}.\n\\] This is a well known but important result; when two structural components are in rigid contact, the impedance at their connection point is equal to the matrix sum of their respective impedances. This result was used in Isolators to justify the in situ characterisation of resilient elements, but at the time was not proven.\nAlthough perfectly admissible, Equation 5 can be written in a more convenient (at least computationally) form using the mathematical relation, \\[\\begin{align}\\label{invSum}\n\\mathbf{Y}_{Scc}^{-1}+\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc}^{-1}  =  \\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc}^{-1}\\left[\\mathbf{Y}_{Scc}+\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc}\\right]\\mathbf{Y}_{Scc}^{-1}.\n\\end{align}\\] Substitution into Equation 5 then yields, \\[\\begin{align}\\label{directPointMob}\n% \\left(\\mathbf{Y}_{Scc}^{-1}+\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc}^{-1}\\right)^{-1}  &=  \\left(\\mathbf{Y}_{Scc}^{-1}\\left[\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc}+\\mathbf{Y}_{Scc}\\right]\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc}^{-1}\\right)^{-1} \\\\\n\\mathbf{Y}_{Ccc} =\\mathbf{Y}_{Scc}\\left[\\mathbf{Y}_{Scc}+\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc}\\right]^{{-1}}\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc}.\n\\end{align}\\] In this modified form, the double matrix inversion is avoided. Matrix inversions are not only computationally expensive, but are known to cause an ‘amplification’ of errors and thus increase overall levels of uncertainty\nSimilar direct relations can be derived for the transfer FRF \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Crc}\\) for rigid and resiliently sources components. However, this direct approach quickly becomes inconvenient as soon as any more components are introduced. Hence, we move on to discus the so-called three field formulation and the resulting primal and dual formulations.",

    "text": "Three field formulation\nWe begin by considering the equations of motion of \\(P\\) sub-structures in a block diagonal form, as given by, \\[\n\\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{f} + \\mathbf{g}\n\\tag{6}\\] where, \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) is the block diagonal impedance matrix of the \\(P\\) uncoupled sub-structures and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), \\(\\mathbf{f}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{g}\\) are the corresponding partitioned column vectors of velocities, applied forces, and coupling interface forces, respectively. \\[\n\\mathbf{Z} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c}\n\\mathbf{Z}^{(1)} & & &\\\\\n&  \\mathbf{Z}^{(2)} & &\\\\\n& & \\mathbf{\\ddots} &\\\\\n& & & \\mathbf{Z}^{(P)}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v} = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\mathbf{v}^{(1)} \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}^{(2)}  \\\\\n\\vdots  \\\\\n\\mathbf{v}^{(P)}  \n\\end{array}\\right),\\quad \\mathbf{f} = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\mathbf{f}^{(1)} \\\\\n\\mathbf{f}^{(2)}  \\\\\n\\vdots  \\\\\n\\mathbf{f}^{(P)}  \n\\end{array}\\right),\n\\quad \\mathbf{g} = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\mathbf{g}^{(1)} \\\\\n\\mathbf{g}^{(2)}  \\\\\n\\vdots  \\\\\n\\mathbf{g}^{(P)}  \n\\end{array}\\right).\n\\] Note that the vibro-acoustic FRF matrix \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) may be included straightforwardly by augmenting the appropriate impedance matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncoupled assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoupled assembly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Substructuring example with remote source (\\(a\\)) and receiver (\\(r\\)) DoFs. Coupling occurs at the interface DoFs, labelled \\(1, \\, 2, \\, 3\\) and \\(4\\).\n\n\n\nAs in the direct formulation, to assemble the individual substructures we must enforce the conditions of equilibrium and continuity. To do so we express Equation 1 and Equation 2 more generally in the form, \\[\n\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0},\n\\tag{7}\\] and \\[\n\\mathbf{L}^{\\rm T}\\mathbf{g} = \\mathbf{0},\n\\tag{8}\\] respectively, where \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) represent signed (contain only 0s, 1s and -1s) and unsigned (contain only (0s and 1s) Boolean matrices, respectively. Together, Equation 6 - Equation 8 are referred to as the three field formulation. They may be solved in a primal or dual manner, depending on whether Equation 7 or Equation 8 is satisfied a priori.\nFor the demonstrative example in Figure 3, \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{L}^{\\rm T}\\) are shown in Figure 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Boolean coupling matrices for example problem in Figure 3.\n\n\n\nNote that for both \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{L}^{\\rm T}\\) the matrix columns correspond to the uncoupled DoFs of the assembly. For \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), the rows correspond to the interface DoFs where coupling occurs, and for \\(\\mathbf{L}^{\\rm T}\\) the coupled DoFs of the assembly. Their substitution into Equation 7 and Equation 8 yields, \\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c c c}\n0 & 1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right] \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nv_a\\\\v_{1}\\\\v_{2} \\\\ v_{3} \\\\v_{4} \\\\ v_b\n\\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n0 \\\\ 0\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\] and \\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c c c}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n0\\\\ g_{1}\\\\g_{2} \\\\ g_{3} \\\\g_{4} \\\\ 0\n\\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n0\\\\0 \\\\ 0 \\\\0\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\] which clearly satisfy the required constraints for rigid coupling.\nFrom the above example we can see that to construct a signed Boolean matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), for each connection (i.e. row of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\)), we assign a 1 and -1 to the columns corresponding to the DoFs to be coupled. The size of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is such that the number of rows is equal to the number of connection points, and the number of columns to the number of uncoupled DoFs.\nTo construct the unsigned Boolean matrix \\(\\mathbf{L}^{\\rm T}\\), for each coupled interface DoF, a pair of 1s are placed in the columns corresponding uncoupled DoF. If a DoF is to be left uncoupled, a 1 is placed in the corresponding column. The size of \\(\\mathbf{L}^{\\rm T}\\) is such that the number of rows is equal to the number of coupled DoFs, and the number of columns to the number of uncoupled DoFs.\n\nPrimal\nThe primal formulation begins by defining a unique set of DoFs \\(\\mathbf{v}_C\\) representing the coupled assembly. Note that number of coupled DoFs is always less than the number of uncoupled DoFs; for every pair of DoFs that we couple we reduced by one the total number of coupled DoFs, see for example Figure 3. As per the condition of continuity, the coupled velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}_C\\) can be related to the uncoupled velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) by an appropriate unsigned Boolean matrix, \\[\n\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{v}_C.\n\\tag{9}\\] The condition of continuity is then given by, \\[\n\\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{v}_C = \\mathbf{0}.\n\\] Note that the above is satisfied irrespective of \\(\\mathbf{v}_C\\), hence \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) represent the null space of one another. This can provide a convenient way of obtaining one Boolean matrix from the other.\nSubstituting Equation 9 into Equation 6 (representing the uncoupled equation of motion) enforces continuity and yields, \\[\n\\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{v}_C = \\mathbf{f} + \\mathbf{g}.\n\\tag{10}\\] Pre-multiplying both sides of Equation 10 by \\(\\mathbf{L}^{\\rm T}\\) we obtain, \\[\n\\mathbf{L}^{\\rm T}\\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{v}_C = \\mathbf{L}^{\\rm T}\\mathbf{f} + \\mathbf{L}^{\\rm T}\\mathbf{g}.\n\\tag{11}\\] Noting Equation 8 it is clear that the condition of equilibrium has now also been satisfied. Pre-multiplying both sides of Equation 11 by the inverse of the left most bracketed term yields, \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_C = \\left(\\mathbf{L}^{\\rm T}\\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{L}\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{f}_C\n\\tag{12}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{f}_C = \\mathbf{L}^{T} \\mathbf{f}\\) represents the external force applied to the coupled assembly, i.e. the sum of external forces acting on each sub-structure. Finally, substituting the block diagonal impedance matrix for the inverse mobility matrix, \\[\n\\mathbf{Z} = \\mathbf{Y}^{-1}, \\quad \\quad \\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c}\n\\mathbf{Z}^{(1)} & & &\\\\\n&  \\mathbf{Z}^{(2)} & &\\\\\n& & \\mathbf{\\ddots} &\\\\\n& & & \\mathbf{Z}^{(P)}\n\\end{array}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c}\n\\mathbf{Y}^{(1)} & & &\\\\\n&  \\mathbf{Y}^{(2)} & &\\\\\n& & \\mathbf{\\ddots} &\\\\\n& & & \\mathbf{Y}^{(P)}\n\\end{array}\\right]^{-1}\n\\] where \\(\\mathbf{Y}^{(P)}\\) is the free mobility of the \\(P\\)th component, we arrive at, \\[\n\\mathbf{Y}_{C} = \\left(\\mathbf{L}^{\\rm T}\\mathbf{Y}^{-1}\\mathbf{L}\\right)^{-1}.\n\\tag{13}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{C}\\) is the mobility of the coupled assembly.\nEquation 13 provides a general framework for determining the FRF matrix (in its entirety) of a coupled assembly. It can be interpreted as a generalisation of the impedance summation obtained by the direct method, as in equation Equation 5. In an experimental context Equation 13 has the downside of requiring several matrix inversions (each block matrix of \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) must be inverted in full). These are not only computationally expensive, but prone to error amplification. For this reason, the primal formulation tends to be considered less reliable than its dual counterpart (discussed below). Nevertheless, for relatively small systems of equations, negligible differences are observed.\n\n\nDual\nThe dual formulation begins by satisfying the condition of equilibrium a priori. This is done by defining the coupling force \\(\\mathbf{g}\\) in the form, \\[\n\\mathbf{g} = -\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\mathbf{\\lambda}\n\\tag{14}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is the same signed Boolean matrix introduced earlier, and \\(\\lambda\\) a Lagrange multiplier representing physically the unknown coupling interface force intensities. \\(\\lambda\\) is termed a force intensity as it possess no directional information. This is allocated by the Boolean matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\).\nThe signed nature of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) ensures collocated force intensities are equal and opposite in direction. The condition of equilibrium is then given by, \\[\n\\mathbf{L}^{\\rm T}\\mathbf{g} = -\\mathbf{L}^{\\rm T}\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\mathbf{\\lambda}  =  \\mathbf{0}.\n\\] Recalling that \\(\\mathbf{L}^{\\rm T}\\), the Boolean matrix satisfying equilibrium as per Equation 8, is in the null space of \\(\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\), the condition of equilibrium is always satisfied.\nSubstituting Equation 14 into Equation 6 the equations of motion become, \\[\n\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{Y}\\left(\\mathbf{f} -\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\lambda \\right)\n\\tag{15}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) again represents the block diagonal matrix of component free mobilties, \\[\n\\mathbf{Y} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c}\n\\mathbf{Y}^{(1)} & & &\\\\\n&  \\mathbf{Y}^{(2)} & &\\\\\n& & \\mathbf{\\ddots} &\\\\\n& & & \\mathbf{Y}^{(P)}\n\\end{array}\\right].\n\\]\nTo determine the coupled assembly response, we must first find \\(\\lambda\\). To do so we begin by substituting Equation 15 into the continuity condition (see Equation 2), \\[\n\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}\\left(\\mathbf{f} -\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\lambda \\right) =\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{f} - \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\lambda = \\mathbf{0}.\n\\] In this sense, \\(\\lambda\\) can be interpreted as the force intensity required to ensure compatibility between connected DoFs. Rearranging the above to find \\(\\lambda\\), \\[\n\\lambda = \\left(\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{f}\n\\] and substituting this into Equation 15 yields the coupled response (since continuity has now be enforced), \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_C = \\mathbf{Y}\\left(\\mathbf{f} -\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\left(\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{f}    \\right) =  \\left(\\mathbf{Y} -\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\left(\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}   \\right)\\mathbf{f}.\n\\] From the above we can identify the coupled mobility \\(\\mathbf{Y}_C\\) as, \\[\n\\mathbf{Y}_C =   \\mathbf{Y} -\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\left(\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}.  \n\\tag{16}\\]\nEquation 16 is a little less intuitive than Equation 13, so it is worth unpacking it a bit more. \\[\n\\mathbf{v}_C =   \\underbrace{\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{f}}_{\\mathbf{v}}-\\overbrace{\\mathbf{Y}\\underbrace{\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\overbrace{\\left(\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\right)^{-1}\\underbrace{\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{f}}_{\\Delta \\mathbf{v}}}^{\\lambda}}_{\\mathbf{g}}}^{\\mathbf{v}_g}\n\\tag{17}\\]\nAs illustrated in Equation 17, the left most \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{f}\\) term describes the response of each component to the applied force whilst uncoupled; being uncoupled, forces only generate responses within the component to which they are applied. The secondary term, \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\left(\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{f}\\) describes the additional contribution \\(\\mathbf{v}_g\\) to this response that arises due to the coupling forces \\(\\mathbf{g}\\) generated by the connected components. It is through this term that forces applied to one component generate responses in others. Breaking down this second term in detail, starting from the right, \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{f}\\) is again the free response of the uncoupled components due to the applied force \\(\\mathbf{f}\\), and so pre-multiplication by \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) yields the velocity between the coupling DoFs, \\(\\Delta \\mathbf{v}\\). The product \\(\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\) when expanded simply yields the sum of the coupling interface FRFs, and so pre-multiplication by the inverse term \\(\\left(\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\right)^{-1}\\) yields the coupling force intensity (see equation \\(\\ref{contFfreeV}\\)). This force is applied to the connecting components with equal magnitude but in opposite directions by \\(\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\), before being propagated through each component by \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\), whereupon its contribution is combined with that of the force applied directly to the component.\nLike Equation 13, Equation 16 provides a general method for determining the mobility matrix of a coupled assembly. Note that in contrast to the primal formulation, the dual formulation requires only a single matrix inversion. Furthermore, after pre- and post-multiplication by \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) (and \\(\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\)) the size of the required inversion is reduced to those of the interface DoFs alone. Hence, the dual formulation is a) computationally more efficient, and b) less prone to error amplification.\nIt is important to note that in deriving Equation 16 we did not define a unique set of assembly DoFs. And so in the dual formulation \\(\\mathbf{Y}_C\\) retains all uncoupled DoFs (interface DoFs are present twice). Care should be take to remove/avoid these duplicate rows and columns if necessary.\n\n\nIncluding resilient coupling\nThe inclusion of resilient elements, such as vibration isolators, in a substructuring procedure is generally straight forward; the coupling element impedance matrix \\(\\mathbf{Z}_I\\) is simply included in the primal formulation as an individual substructure, or for the dual formulation its mobility matrix \\(\\mathbf{Y}_I\\). However, in the case of ideal springs, the coupling element’s mobility matrix \\(\\mathbf{Y}_I\\) does not exist and so an alternative approach is required as described in the following.\nLet us consider the simplest resilient coupling, that of an ideal spring-damper. The impedance matrix of such an element is given by, \\[\n\\mathbf{Z}_I = \\left[\\begin{array}{c c}\n\\frac{K}{i\\omega}+C & -(\\frac{K}{i\\omega}+ C) \\\\-(\\frac{K}{i\\omega}+ C) & \\frac{K}{i\\omega}+ C\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\] where \\(K\\) is the stiffness of the spring, and \\(C\\) is damping (assumed here to be of viscous type). An element of this form can be substituted directly in to the primal formulation as the equilibrium and continuity constraints are applied to the impedance matrices of each sub-structure (see Equation 12). In contrast, the dual formulation requires the mobility matrix of each element (see Equation 16), and so the coupling impedance must be inverted. Note however, that \\(\\mathbf{Z}_I\\) is singular. Its columns are linearly related by a factor of -1. Physically, this is because a force applied to an unconstrained, mass-less system causes an infinite response. Hence, an element impedance of this form is not compatible with the dual formulation as described above.\nThere are number of way to get around this apparent issue, two of which we will discuss here. The simplest approach is to add a small ‘virtual mass’ \\(M\\) to either end of the ideal spring. By doing so the element’s impedance becomes, \\[\n\\mathbf{Z}_I = \\left[\\begin{array}{c c}\n\\frac{K}{i\\omega}+C +i\\omega M& -(\\frac{K}{i\\omega}+ C) \\\\-(\\frac{K}{i\\omega}+ C) & \\frac{K}{i\\omega}+C +i\\omega M\n\\end{array}\\right].\n\\] Note that \\(\\mathbf{Z}_I\\) is no longer singular. It can be inverted to obtain the mobility \\(\\mathbf{Y}_I\\) and used within the dual formulation, though, care should be taken when adding this virtual mass. If it is made too large, noticeable effects will be introduced to the systems dynamics. The mass be chosen such that the local non-zero eigen frequencies of the coupling are at least 10 times greater than the frequency range of interest. Alternatively, the effect of the additional mass can be cancelled by coupling a second negative virtual mass to the assembly. This way the virtual mass can be chosen arbitrarily.\nThe second approach is to consider the resilient coupling as a relaxation of the continuity condition. That is, the connecting DoFs are no longer constrained to have the same velocity; the presence of a resilient element allows for their relative movement. We can then redefine an appropriate continuity condition as, \\[\n\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{\\delta} \\neq \\mathbf{0}\n\\] where \\(\\mathbf{\\delta}\\) represents the relative velocity of the two interface DoFs. In the presence of an ideal spring-like coupling, this relative velocity can be expressed in terms of the internal force generated by the spring-damper \\(\\lambda\\), \\[\\label{}\n\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{v} =\\mathbf{\\delta} = \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}\\lambda\n\\tag{18}\\] where \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma} = \\mbox{diag}\\left[\\frac{K_1}{i\\omega}+C_1,\\cdots, \\frac{K_N}{i\\omega}+C_N\\right]^{-1}\\) describes the inverse point impedance (i.e. mobility) of the \\(N\\) coupling elements. Note that the condition of equilibrium is unchanged. This is because of the massless assumption of the spring-damper coupling, meaning force is conserved across it, and so \\(\\mathbf{g}_1 = \\mathbf{g}_2\\). Substituting Equation 15 into Equation 18 we can rearrange to get \\(\\lambda\\), \\[\n\\lambda = \\left(\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T} + \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{f}.\n\\tag{19}\\] Finally, substituting Equation 19 back into Equation 15, we arrive at, \\[\n\\mathbf{Y}_C =   \\mathbf{Y} -\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T}\\left(\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm T} + \\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Y}.  \n\\tag{20}\\] Equation 20 describes the mobility of a resiliently (spring-damper-like) coupled assembly, where \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}\\) characterises the coupling element.\nNote that the now permitted relative motion between the two sides of the coupling means that the dual method no longer produces duplicate rows/columns.",

    "text": "Problem description\nA complex structure (say a vehcile, building, ship or air-craft) whose wave propagation characteristics are described by the function \\(G(\\quad)\\) is excited by a set of discrete forces \\(\\mathbf{f}_i\\) and distributed pressures \\(p(x)\\) which arise due to internal operating mechanisms and external loading (e.g. turbulence), respectively. These forces induce a vibration which propagates through the structure; where upon reaching the position \\(b\\) is observed as a structural velocity, say in the \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) directions, \\(\\mathbf{v}_r = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} v_{r,x} & v_{r,y} & v_{r,z}\\end{array}\\right]^{\\mathrm T}\\), or perhaps an acoustic response \\(p_r\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Source-receiver model for structure-borne problems. \\(\\mathbf{f}_i\\) are the internal forces generated by any moving mechanisms, \\(p(r)\\) is the external pressure loading, \\(c\\) are the interface connection points between source and receiver, \\(r\\) are a set of target points within the receiver structure and \\(b\\) are a set of additiona DoFs used later for in direct estimation of the blocked force.\n\n\n\nIn equation form we have that, \\[\n    \\mathbf{v}_r = G(\\mathbf{f}_i, p(x)).\n\\]\nIf we assume linearity and time invariance, this problem can be expressed conveniently in the frequency domain in terms of the assembly’s frequency response functions (FRFs), \\[\n     \\mathbf{v}_r(\\omega) = \\overbrace{\\mathbf{Y}_{Cri}(\\omega)\\mathbf{f}_i(\\omega)}^{\\mbox{Discrete forcing}} + \\overbrace{\\int_{\\Omega S} Y_C(r|x_0) p(x_0) {\\mathrm d} S}^{\\mbox{ Continuous forcing}}\n\\] where \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Cri}\\) is a matrix of mobilities relating the discrete forces \\(\\mathbf{f}_i\\) to the responses in \\(\\mathbf{v}_r\\), \\(Y_C(r|x_0)\\) is a continuous mobility function relating the force at position \\(x_0\\) to the response \\(\\mathbf{v}_r\\) at position \\(r\\), \\(\\omega\\) is the radian frequency (omitted hereafter for brevity). The capitalised sub-script \\(C\\) is used to denote that the mobility belongs to the assembly (i.e. with the vibration source attached to the receiver).\nWhilst the above representation of the problem is perfectly admissible, it has some practical issues if the aim is to predict the response \\(\\mathbf{v}_r\\). First, the internal forces and pressures \\(\\mathbf{f}_i\\) and \\(p(x)\\) are generally unknown, or at least very difficult to determine. Second, the location of said internal forces might not be obvious, and so the corresponding FRFs are also challenging to define. A solution to this problem is to find an alternative description of the source activity that:\n\nis able to physically represent the acting forces and pressures (i.e. induce the same vibration in the receiver structure),\nwhose positions are known and,\nwhose magnitudes can be determined practically.\n\nBy combining an appropriate description of source activity with the passive transfer characteristics of the structure, the prediction of structure-borne sound, due to arbitrarily complex mechanisms, is made possible.\nTo tackle the above, and remain inkeeping with our VAVP framework, it is natural to consider the source of vibration as a component, as opposed to the set of internal forces \\(\\mathbf{f}_i\\) and external pressures \\(p(x)\\). We can therefore represent the problem generally as in Figure 1, where the vibration source component \\(S\\) is attached to a receiver structure \\(R\\) at the interface connection points labeled \\(c\\). These connections points are described by a number of degrees of freedom (DoFs), which represent the dynamics/motions in different directions. For point-like connections these DoFs are the translations in \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) and the rotation about each of these axis, \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\).\nAssuming the source and receiver components are coupled at a series of (approx.) discrete (point-like) connections, it is possible to simplify the problem by considering the forces that are occurring at the interface \\(c\\). Being both discrete and accessible, these interface forces provide an alternative means of representing the complex internal forces within the source. In a sense, the discrete interface between the source and receiver acts as a `’. Whilst the source-side excitation may be incredibly complex and applied over an extended area, as the induced receiver vibration is transmitted through the interface, only a reduced set of motions are possible. Assuming that each connection behaves in a point-like manner (i.e. is locally rigid), only 6 DoFs (three translations and three rotations) are permitted. Hence, for \\(N\\) connection points, the response within the receiver can be represented entirely by \\(6N\\) interface forces.\n\nSource characterisation\nWhen characterising a vibration source, particularly for the purpose of building a VAVP, it is essential that we obtain an independent’ characterisation. That is, a characterisation of the source that does not depend on the dynamics of the receiver. Doing so would allow for the same source characterisation to be used to predict the response of different receiver structures. There are two fundamental source descriptions that satisfy the required independence: the free velocity, and the blocked force. Whilst both the free velocity and the blocked force provide an independent characterisation, the free velocity is rarely used in practice. Indeed, it is the blocked force that has gained popularity in the last few years, so much so that an international standard has been devised for its (in direct) measurement.",

    "section": "Blocked force",
    "text": "Blocked force\nThe blocked force is used almost universly when building VAVPs. It is an independent source quantity that can be obtained practically through an in direct method (detailed below).\n\nDefinition\nThe blocked force of a vibration source is the force required to rigidly constrain its interface degrees of freedom (DoFs) such that their velocity (also displacement and acceleration) is zero. Said another way, the blocked force is the reaction force presented by an infinitely rigid receiver structure when a connected vibration source operates. This notion is illustrated in Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Blocked force of a vibration source. The interface DoFs \\(c\\) are rigidly constrained by the blocked force \\(\\mathbf{\\bar{f}}_{c}\\).\n\n\n\nMathematically, we can define the blocked force as, \\[\n    \\mathbf{\\bar{f}}_{c} = \\mathbf{{g}}_{c}\\Big|_{\\mathbf{v}_{c}=\\mathbf{0}}\n\\] where \\(\\mathbf{g}_{c}\\) is the contact force at the interface \\(c\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{c}=\\mathbf{0}\\) is the rigid constraint. It is clear that by blocking the interface DoFs, the blocked force provides an independent source description. The influence of any receiver structure has been removed by constraining the interface DoFs. It is worth noting that the blocked force is a somewhat hypothetical force, it is defined by means of an infinitely rigid constraint which in practice can not be achieved.\n\n\nIn situ measurement of blocked force\nTo characterise the blocked force of a vibration source directly it is necessary to attach the source to an (approx.) infinitely rigid test bench, for example a large blocking mass, with force transducers placed between the source contacts and the test bench. Clearly, this `infinitely rigid’ requirement can only be satisfied approximately over a particular frequency range; even the most rigid test bench will eventually enter a modal/flexible regime. Achieving a sufficiently rigid condition can be further complicated by the mounting requirements of the source. Another notable challenge involves the determination of rotational and in-plane blocked forces. Hence, the direct measurement of the blocked force is fraught with difficulties and generally not practical. Fortunately, an in direct measurement approach is available.\nThe direct method described above is focused on measuring force directly, by means of installed force transducers. The indirect approach involves the measurement of the assemblies operational response (e.g. velocity), from which we infer the unknown blocked force.\nThe key equation on which the indirect approach is based is given by, \\[  \n\\mathbf{v}_{b} = (-)\\mathbf{Y}_{Cbc}\\mathbf{\\bar{f}}_{c}\n\\tag{1}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{v}_{b}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N_b}\\) is the operational velocity (to be measured) of the structure at a set of ‘indicator’ positions \\(b\\), \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Cbc}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N_b\\times N_c}\\) is the transfer mobility of the assembled structure (also to be measured), and \\(\\mathbf{\\bar{f}}_{c}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N_c}\\) is the unknown blocked force. Equation 1 provides a relation between the blocked force of a vibration source and the velocity of the assembly in which it is installed. Theoretically, Equation 1 includes a negative sign, for reasons that will be explained shortly. However, this negative sign has no bearing on the in situ method itself as its simply a \\(180^\\circ\\) phase shift. For this reason, the negative sign is often let out of the equation, as we done hereafter.\nNote that the indicator DoFs \\(b\\) can be located at the interface \\(c\\), in which case Equation 1 becomes, \\[\n    \\mathbf{v}_{c} = \\mathbf{Y}_{Ccc}\\mathbf{\\bar{f}}_{c}\n\\tag{2}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{v}_{c}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N_b}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Ccc}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N_c\\times N_c}\\) are the operational velocity and point FRF matrix of the interface \\(c\\).\nTo determine the blocked force we have to solve the ‘inverse problem’. Pre-multiplication of both sides of Equation 1 and Equation 2 by the inverse mobility matrix yields, \\[\n    \\mathbf{\\bar{f}}_{c} = \\mathbf{Y}_{Cbc}^{-1}\\mathbf{v}_{b} \\quad \\quad  \\mbox{and} \\quad \\quad  \\mathbf{\\bar{f}}_{c} = \\mathbf{Y}_{Ccc}^{-1}\\mathbf{v}_{c}\n\\tag{3}\\] the latter of which is generally preferred as measurements made away from the interface \\(c\\) are more easily corrupted, e.g. by external disturbances, etc. Alternatively, Equation 3 can be combined and written in a more general form, \\[\n    \\mathbf{\\bar{f}}_{c} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n        \\mathbf{Y}_{Ccc}\\\\\n        \\mathbf{Y}_{Cbc}\n    \\end{array}\\right]^+\n     \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n        \\mathbf{v}_{c}\\\\\n        \\mathbf{v}_{b}\n    \\end{array}\\right) = \\mathbf{Y}_C^+\\mathbf{v}\n\\tag{4}\\] where \\(\\square^+\\) denotes the matrix pseduo-inverse.\nTo solve Equation 4, it is necessary that number of measured velocities (\\(M\\)) is equal to, or greater than, the number of blocked forces that are being determined. That is, to determine \\(N\\) blocked forces, \\(M\\geq N\\) velocities should be recorded. The dimensions of the mobility matrix \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{C}\\) should be consistent with those of the blocked force and velocity vectors, it should be \\(M\\times N\\). The number of recorded velocities relative to the number of blocked forces will be discussed further in a later section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Illustration of blocked force as an equivalent force. The response generated within the domain of \\(R\\) due to the applied (negative) blocked force (whilst source is inactive) is identical to that generated by the internal forces and pressures in Figure 3 (i.e. when the source is active).\n\n\n\nImportantly, Equation 4 provides a means of determining the blocked force without requiring an infinitely rigid test bench. In fact, no restrictions are placed on the assembly \\(C\\) in which the source is installed. As such, Equation 4 enables an in situ characterisation of the blocked force; the source need not be removed from its intended installation. It thus provides a practical source characterisation method.\nThe experimental implementation of the in situ approach follows a two part measurement procedure:\n\nThe source is turned off and the mobility matrix \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Cbc}\\) is measured between the interface and indicator DoFs. This is typically done by applying a known force to each interface DoF (using an instrumented force hammer or a roving shaker) whilst simultaneously measuring the response at all indicator DoFs (typically using accelerometers). Note that if the interface DoFs are not accessible for excitation the principle of reciprocity can be used to interchange the excitation and response positions, \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Cbc} = \\mathbf{Y}_{Ccb}^{\\rm T}\\).\nThe source is turned on and the operational velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}_{b}\\) is measured at the indicator DoFs. This is typically done using the same set of response sensors as used in part 1.\n\nBefore conducting part two of the above procedure, it is generally good practice to perform a number of data checks to a) inspect the quality of the measured mobility matrix, and b) ensure sufficient number of DoFs have been accounted for (i.e. the interface is complete).\n\n\nA nice simple proof\nHere we present a simple ‘equation free’ proof of the in situ blocked force relation in Equation 2 by considering the principle of linear superposition as illustrated in Figure 5. More mathematical proofs are available in the literature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Whilst internal forces are active an external force is applied to the interface which constrains its response to 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Whilst internal forces are inactive the external force is reversed and response field is reproduced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: In situ blocked force proof based on principle of superposition.\n\n\n\nConsider the vibration source to be active. The internal and boundary forces (\\(\\mathbf{f}_i\\) and \\(p(x)\\)) generate a response field \\(v_i\\) within the reciever domain \\(R\\). An external (blocking) force is then applied across the interface DoFs \\(c\\) that rigidly constrains its motion. With the interface DoFs now fixed, no vibration can be transmitted into the recevier, and so its response is 0 at all positions. An alterntive interpretation is that the external blocking force generates a secondary wave field \\(v_c\\) in the receiver that is equal in magnitude, but opposite in phase to the original wave field such that their sum is zero (\\(v_R = v_i + v_c = 0\\)).\nIf these forces are applied at the interface so as to nullify the interface response, and the machine is then switched off, as in Figure 5 (b), we are left with a response field that must be simply the reverse of the original field \\(v_c = -v_i\\). Simply reversing the sign we conclude that *the response field within the receiver can be reproduced identically by applying the negative blocking forces to the interface, or in equation form, \\[  \n\\mathbf{v}_{r} = (-)\\mathbf{Y}_{Crc}\\mathbf{\\bar{f}}_{c}\n\\] for any DoFs \\(r\\) within the receiver.\n\n\nValidation\nBefore the blocked force can be used within a VAVP, it is essential that some sort of validation is performed to give us confidence that a correct identification has been acheived. This can be done in various ways, though the most common is by what is termed an on-board validation.\n\nOn-board validation\nThis validation is pretty simple. During the characterisation of the blocked force, one or more of the remote \\(b\\) DoFs are ommitted from the inverse calculation (i.e. Equation 4). After the blocked force has been obtained, a forward response prediction is made for the as yet unused \\(b\\) DoFs, denoted \\(\\tilde{b}\\) here, \\[  \n\\mathbf{v}_{\\tilde{b}} = \\mathbf{Y}_{C\\tilde{b}c}\\mathbf{\\bar{f}}_{c}\n\\tag{5}\\] where it should be made clear that both \\(\\mathbf{v}_{\\tilde{b}}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{C\\tilde{b}c}\\) are measured during the initial measurement campaign (i.e. simultaneous to those used in the characterisation). An on-board validation then amounts to a comparision of the predicted and directly measured responses \\(\\mathbf{v}_{\\tilde{b}}\\). This comparision can be done in anyway the user prefers, e.g. by a mean squares error or a correlation-based metric (e.g. MAC), though is most commonly done simply by visual inspection, i.e. plotting measured and predicted responses together.\n\n\nModified reciever validation\nThe on-board validation procedure described above, though convenient and an important step in critiquing the blocked force, is not the most robust form of validation. Indeed, one could obtain an excellent on-board validation, but get terrible agreement once the blocked force is transfered to a VAVP. In other words, since the charactrisation and validation assemblies share the same dynamics, some potential errors might not come to light. For this reason, a more robust validation is to predict into a different assembly.\nThe most convenient way of doing this is to introduce a structural modification onto the recevier structure used for the initial characterisation, thus altering its dynamics and forming a new assembly, \\(C\\rightarrow \\tilde{C}\\). A validation is then obtained by 1) running the source on this modified recevier, 2) remeasuring its coupled FRF \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{\\tilde{C}bc}\\) (note that all \\(b\\) DoFs can now be used since we are effectivly using a new assembly), 3) recording the operational response \\(v_b\\), 4) and using the blocked force from assembly \\(C\\) to predict the response in \\(\\tilde{C}\\), \\[  \n\\mathbf{v}_{b} = \\mathbf{Y}_{\\tilde{C}bc}\\mathbf{\\bar{f}}_{c}\n\\] Again, comparison of predicted and measured responses gives an idea of the predictive accuracy of the aquired blocked forces. Of course, additional validation steps are recommended when building a full VAVP (including transferability and substructuring vsalidations), though these are not addressed here.",

    "text": "What next?\nWe now have everything we need to build a VAVP: methods for characterising the passive properties of vibration sources, receiver structures and coupling elements; a means of coupling these components together to build an assembly; and a method of characterising the active properties of vibration sources by their blocked forces, thus allowing us to ‘turn on’ our VAVP. All thats left to do is put it all together. In summary, the steps to build a VAVP are:\n\nCharacterise the vibration source by first freely suspending it (e.g. hang from resilient bungees) and measure its free-interface FRF matrix \\(\\mathbf{Y}_S\\). Next, instal the source onto some test bench and characterise the blocked force \\(\\mathbf{\\bar{f}}\\) using the in situ method. This completes the source characterisation.\nMeasure (or model) the free-interface FRF of the receviering structure to obtain \\(\\mathbf{Y}_R\\), and \\(\\mathbf{H}_R\\) if acoustic responses are of interest.\nIf the source and receiver are to be resiliently coupled, characterise the chosen isolator(s) by first installing it between two simple components (e.g. two masses) and then using in situ method with either force conservation or decoupling. Repeat this process to obtain an isolator FRF matrix \\(\\mathbf{Y}_I\\) for each coupling element. (Note that a model could also be used to characterise the element)\nCouple the components together using substructuring to build a model of the assembly \\(\\mathbf{Y}_C\\) (\\(\\mathbf{H}_C\\)).\nFinally, apply the blocked force obtained from step 1. to the substructured FRF obtained from step 4. to make a response prediction for the VAVP.\n\nThough not an essential step when building a VAVP, it is good practice whenever building any type of model to develop some understanding of the errors involved. It should be obvious that a VAVP prediction with an accompanying confidence bound is far more valuable than one without… Thus, the final topic we will discuss is that of Uncertainties.",

Independence is the key word here, it is what enables components to be assembled, and interchanged within the VAVP framework.\nThe independent properties of a passive component can be described in various ‘domains’, each providing a different perspective on essentially the same dynamic behaviour. The Physical, State-space, Modal, Time, and Frequency domains are the most commonly encountered in vibro-acoustics and will be briefly reviewed below before we adopt the Frequency domain as the default for our VAVP.\nIn the physical domain, a component’s inertial and elastic properties are discretised (\\(N\\) DoFs, for example by the Finite Element Method) and represented by the mass and stiffness matrices, \\(\\mathbf{M}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times N}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{K}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times N}\\), respectively. Together with an appropriate matrix representation of its damping, \\(\\mathbf{C}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times N}\\), these matrices characterise the passive properties of a component. They can be used to formulate a second order equation of motion that relates the external force \\(\\mathbf{f}(t)\\) applied to the component, to its resulting kinematics, \\[\n        \\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{\\ddot{x}}(t)+\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}(t)+\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{x}(t) = \\mathbf{f}(t)\n\\tag{1}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{x}(t)\\), \\(\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}(t)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{\\ddot{x}}(t)\\) are vectors of displacement, velocity and acceleration, respectively at a each of the \\(n\\) discretised degrees of freedom.\nIn the state-space domain, a component is represented by a set of first order differential equations that relate the state vector \\(\\mathbf{y}(t) = [\\mathbf{x}^{\\rm T}(t) \\quad \\mathbf{\\dot{x}}^{\\rm T}(t)]^{\\rm T}\\) to its temporal derivative, \\(\\mathbf{\\dot{y}}(t) = [\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}^{\\rm T}(t) \\quad \\mathbf{\\ddot{x}}^{\\rm T}(t)]^{\\rm T}\\).

Together, \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) characterise the passive properties of a component in state-space.\nIn the modal domain a component is represented by a set of mode shapes \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Phi} = [\\mathbf{\\phi}_1 \\quad \\mathbf{\\phi}_2 \\quad \\cdots \\quad \\mathbf{\\phi}_N]\\) and natural frequencies \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}=\\mbox{diag}[\\omega^2_1 \\quad \\omega^2_2 \\quad \\cdots \\quad \\omega^2_N]\\) which individually satisfy the homogenous undamped equation of motion, ** -^2 = _i = 0. ** Together \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}\\), with an appropriate representation of damping (e.g. modal loss factor), characterise the passive properties of the component.\nIn the time domain a component’s kinematic response \\(\\mathbf{x}(t)\\), \\(\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}(t)\\) or \\(\\mathbf{\\ddot{x}}(t)\\) to a time varying force \\(\\mathbf{f}(t)\\) satisfies the convolution integral (shown only for displacement), ** (t) = _0^{} (t-)() d ** where \\(\\mathbf{G}(t)\\) is a matrix of displacement impulse response functions (IRFs) that describe the component response to a unit (dirac) force impulse. The IRF matrix \\(\\mathbf{G}(t)\\) characterises the passive properties of a component.\nIn the FRF domain a component is characterised by its frequency response function (FRF) matrix, which can take several forms. Assuming time harmonic motion, Equation 1 can be Fourier transformed into the frequency domain,  (i++)() = ()() = ()  where \\(\\mathbf{Z}(\\omega)\\) is the component impedance FRF matrix. Equivalently we can write, \\[\n    \\mathbf{v}(\\omega) = \\mathbf{Y}(\\omega)\\mathbf{f}(\\omega)\n\\tag{2}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{Y}(\\omega)=\\mathbf{Z}^{-1}(\\omega)\\) is the component mobility FRF matrix. Both \\(\\mathbf{Y}(\\omega)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Z}(\\omega)\\) characterise the passive properties of a component. Similar FRF definitions exist for displacement and acceleration, as discussed below.\nThe choice of domain depends, amongst other things, on whether a physical structure is available for test. If no experimental characterisation is possible, the conventional starting point is a finite element model, i.e. in the physical domain. In this case, reliable estimates of the mass, stiffness and damping properties of the structure are required (not always easily found) for input to Equation 1. From here, state-space, modal, IRF, or FRF representations can be determined. If a physical component available for testing, then representation by measured FRFs is often preferred. These do not require estimates of the component’s physical properties because the FRF is directly obtained from measured forces and velocities (Equation 2). From measured FRFs, IRF and modal representations can be determined with relative ease. However, physical and state-space domains are typically limited to numerical models; identifying system matrices (e.g. mass, stiffness, state, etc) from experimental data is a difficult problem requiring advanced system identification methods. Being able to represent both experimentally and numerically sourced components, the frequency domain is the obvious choice for VAVPs.",

    "text": "Frequency response functions\nFrequency response functions (FRFs) are a clearly central concept in the development of VAVPs, and so it is only fair that we devote sometime to their definition and interpretation.\n\nTypes of FRF\nHaving chosen the FRF as our preferred representation, it still remains to choose the dynamic quantities involved: generally speaking, FRFs describe input-output relations and it is to be decided whether the inputs and outputs are forces, kinematic or acoustic quantities. If a kinematic quantity, is this in the form of acceleration, velocity or displacement? In addition, are rotational quantities such as moments or angular velocities involved?\nOur first choice will be to consider excitation in terms of applied force and response in terms of resultant velocity giving a force-velocity type of FRF known as ‘mobility’, typically denoted by \\(Y(\\omega)\\in \\mathbb{C}\\). For a single input-output system, it is a complex frequency dependent scalar quantity that describes the velocity response to a unit force excitation at a point, defined mathematically as, \\[\n    v(\\omega) = Y(\\omega)f(\\omega), \\quad \\quad Y(\\omega) = \\frac{v(\\omega)}{f(\\omega)}\n\\tag{3}\\] where \\(v(\\omega)\\) and \\(f(\\omega)\\) are the complex frequency domain spectra of the velocity and force, respectively.\nBeing complex, the mobility has a real and imaginary part. Physically, the real part is typically associated with damping mechanisms and losses, whilst the imaginary part is related to energy storage. When visualising or plotting a mobility FRF is it rare that we look directly at its real or imaginary parts. Rather, we consider its polar representation in terms of magnitude \\(|Y|\\) and phase \\(\\angle Y\\), \\[\\begin{align}\n        v_0(\\omega,t )e^{i(\\omega t + \\angle Y)} &= \\left[\\mbox{Re}(Y(\\omega)) + i\\mbox{Im}(Y(\\omega))\\right]f_0(\\omega)e^{i \\omega t} \\\\\n            &=|Y(\\omega)|e^{i\\angle Y}f_0(\\omega)e^{i \\omega t}\n    \\end{align}\\] where the magnitude of the mobility (or any FRF) describes the change in amplitude between a harmonic input (in the case of mobility, force) and output signal (velocity), whilst the phase describes the time difference between the input and output introduced by the system at a particular frequency.\nFRFs in terms of displacement and acceleration, rather than velocity, are frequently found in the literature. It is straightforward to convert between the various kinematic quanties. By integration and differentiation with respect to time (assuming harmonic motion \\(v=v_0e^{i\\omega t}\\)), Equation 3 can be transformed into a pair of force-displacement and force-acceleration relations, respectively, \\[\nv = \\frac{dx}{dt} = i\\omega x = Yf, \\quad \\quad v = \\int a dt = \\frac{a}{i\\omega} = Y f\n\\] where for simplicity we have omitted explicit frequency dependence \\((\\omega)\\). From the above we have the FRF relations, \\[\n    x = \\frac{Y}{i\\omega} f = R f,\\quad \\quad a = i\\omega Y f = Af\n\\] where \\(R\\in \\mathbb{C}\\) is called the (dynamic) compliance and \\(A\\in \\mathbb{C}\\) the accelerance. Thus in the frequency domain, multiplication or division by \\(i\\omega\\) is all that is required to convert one from one form to another.\nAccompanying each of the FRFs above is an inverse FRF in which the excitation is an imposed motion and the response a reaction force, \\[\n    f = D x,\\quad \\quad f = Z v, \\quad \\quad f = \\hat{M} a.\n\\] where, \\[\n    D = \\frac{1}{R},\\quad \\quad Z = \\frac{1}{Y}, \\quad \\quad \\hat{M} = \\frac{1}{A}.\n\\] The FRFs \\(D\\in \\mathbb{C}\\), \\(Z\\in \\mathbb{C}\\) and \\(\\hat{M}\\in \\mathbb{C}\\) are called, respectively, the dynamic stiffness, impedance, and apparent mass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese days, most of the literature related to VAVP and TPA use acceleration, rather than velocity, as their base kineamtic quantity. This is because acceleraion is super easy to measure (thank you accelerometers!). That said, in the vast majority of cases the choice of kinematic variable is completely arbitrary; the same underlying equations can be applied to displacement, velocity and acceleration-based FRFs. In fact, we will rarely refer to a specific type of FRF (i.e. compliance, mobility, accelerance), adopting instead the agnostic term FRF. Similarly, when taking about the kinematic quantity directly (i.e. displacement, velocity, acceleration) we will use the term generic term response. Note, when reffering to the inverse FRF (i.e. dynamic stiffness, impedance and apparent mass) we will use impedance as a general term without specific reference to velocity.\nAn important exption to the above is when dealing with power-based methods, since power is defined specifically in terms of velocity and force. If using displacement or acceleration-based FRFs, approaiate frequency scaling must be included to yield correct power estimates.\n\n\nImportantly, the above definitions concern single-input single-output systems in which all FRFs are (complex) quantities. When dealing with multi-input multi-output systems, as is necessary for virtual prototyping, a more general FRF definition is required that allows for simultaneous excitation and response at multiple points.\n\n\nMulti-DoF FRFs\nVery rarely are structural components excited at, or connected through, a single point. In almost all scenarios, the FRFs needed for component-level simulation are multi-point. In the following we will specifically consider multi-point FRF and impedance FRFs, though the definitions apply equally to other types of FRF. As is common practice, we will also omit specific reference to frequency dependence from now on. All formulations throughout the remainder of this book are assumed to be in the frequency domain unless stated otherwise.\nFor a component with \\(N\\) inputs and outputs, its FRF is defined by the vector-matrix equation, \\[\n\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{Y}\\mathbf{f}\n\\tag{4}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{C}^N\\) is an \\(N\\) dimensional vector of responses, \\(\\mathbf{f} \\in \\mathbb{C}^N\\) is an \\(N\\) dimensional vector of applied forces, and \\(\\mathbf{Y} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N\\times N}\\) is the \\(N\\times N\\) dimensional FRF matrix that relates the two. Written out in full Equation 4 reads, \\[\n    \\left(\\begin{array}{c} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_N\n    \\end{array}\\right) = \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\n        Y_{11} & Y_{12} & \\cdots & Y_{1N} \\\\\n        Y_{21} & Y_{22} & \\cdots & Y_{2N} \\\\\n        \\vdots & \\vdots & \\cdots & \\ddots \\\\\n        Y_{N1} & Y_{N2} & \\cdots & Y_{NN} \\\\\n    \\end{array}\\right]\\left(\\begin{array}{c} f_1 \\\\ f_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ f_N\n    \\end{array}\\right)\n\\tag{5}\\] where the first sub-scripted index \\(i\\) denotes the response position (the rows of \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\)), and the second index \\(j\\) the force excitation position (the columns of \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\)).\nWith reference to Equation 5, we can distinguish two types of FRF; point and transfer. Point FRFs describe the response at a point when the force excitation is at the same position, i.e. co-located, \\(v_i = Y_{ii}f_i\\). Transfer FRFs describe the velocity at a point when the excitation force is located elsewhere, \\(v_i=Y_{ij}f_j, j\\neq i\\).\nWhen excitations and responses are considered across the same set of positions, \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\in \\mathbb{C}^{N\\times N}\\)$ is a square symmetric matrix (\\(Y_{ij} = Y_{ji}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{Y} = \\mathbf{Y}^{\\rm T}\\)). Its diagonal elements contain the point FRFs at each position, whilst the off-diagonal elements contain the transfer FRFs between each pair of positions. The symmetry of \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) arises due to an important feature of FRFs; they are reciprocal, meaning that when the input and output positions are interchanged the FRF remains the same, i.e. \\(Y_{ij} = Y_{ji}\\). The same is true for all FRFs described above.\nEquation 5 provides a component-level definition of a multi-DoF FRF. To obtain an element wise definition for \\(Y_{ij}\\), we must isolate a single element of the FRF matrix. We do this by considering the response at an arbitrary position \\(i\\), due to a single applied force at position \\(j\\); that is, we set all forces other than that at \\(j\\) to zero, \\(f_{k\\neq j}=0\\). Equation 5 then reduces to the element wise FRF definition, \\[\nY_{ij} = {v_i \\over f_j}  \\Big|_{f_{k \\neq j} = 0}.\n\\tag{6}\\]\nBased on Equation 6, the measurement of an FRF matrix should be done in such a way that:\n\nforces are applied one at a time to each point of interest;\nexternal forces at all other points are zero (the structure is allowed to respond freely);\nthe individual elements of the matrix are then measured as the complex ratio of the response at \\(i\\) to the single excitation force at \\(j\\), as per Equation 6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobility FRF constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpedance FRF constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the element-wise constraints on the definition of mobility and impedance FRFs.\n\n\n\nConsidering the same component with \\(N\\) co-located inputs and outputs, its impedance is defined by the vector-matrix equation, \\[\n\\mathbf{f} = \\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{v}\n\\] where \\(\\mathbf{f} \\in \\mathbb{C}^N\\) is an \\(N\\) dimensional vector of resultant forces, \\(\\mathbf{v}\\in \\mathbb{C}^N\\) is an \\(N\\) dimensional vector of applied velocities and \\(\\mathbf{Z} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N\\times N}\\) is the \\(N \\times N\\) dimensional impedance matrix that relates the two. Written out in full, \\[\n    \\left(\\begin{array}{c} f_1 \\\\ f_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ f_N\n    \\end{array}\\right) = \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\n        Z_{11} & Z_{12} & \\cdots & Z_{1N} \\\\\n        Z_{21} & Z_{22} & \\cdots & Z_{2N} \\\\\n        \\vdots & \\vdots & \\cdots & \\ddots \\\\\n        Z_{N1} & Z_{N2} & \\cdots & Z_{NN} \\\\\n    \\end{array}\\right]\\left(\\begin{array}{c} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_N\n    \\end{array}\\right).\n\\] As above for the FRF, the first sub-scripted index denotes the response position (now a resultant force), and the second index the excitation position (now an applied motion).\nLike the FRF matrix, when excitations and responses are considered across the same set of \\(N\\) positions, \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N\\times N}\\) is a square symmetric (i.e. reciprocal) matrix (\\(Z_{ij} = Z_{ji}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{Z} = \\mathbf{Z}^{\\rm T}\\)), with the so-called point impedances along the diagonal, and transfer impedances elsewhere.\nTo obtain an element-wise definition of the impedance \\(Z_{ij}\\), we must isolate a single element of the matrix \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\). Following the same procedure as before, we consider an arbitrary force location \\(i\\) and set all motions, bar that applied to position \\(j\\), to zero, \\(v_{k\\neq j} = 0\\). We are then left with the element-wise definition, \\[\nZ_{ij} = {\\bar{f}_i \\over v_j} \\Big|_{v_{k \\neq j} = 0}\n\\tag{7}\\] where it is noted that in order to satisfy the constraint \\(v_{k \\neq j} = 0\\), an external blocking force \\(\\bar{f}\\) is required at all positions \\({k \\neq j}\\).\nBased on Equation 7, an impedance matrix would be measured in such a way that:\n\nprescribed motions are applied one at a time to each point of interest;\nthe motion of all other points is constrained to zero (the structure is not allowed to move);\nthe individual elements of the matrix are then measured as the complex ratio of the force response to the prescirbed motion, as per Equation 7.\n\nIn contrast to FRF, the measurement of impedance required all points other than the excited point to be completely constrained, in other words they must be fixed. These different constraints for FRF and impedance have major practical implications for measurement. In short; impedance cannot be directly measured (at least not in a practical or reliable way), whilst mobility can (and with no great difficulty, usually…).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAn important consequence of the element wise constraint in Equation 7 is that the elements of the impedance matrix depend on the position and number of DoFs being considered. If a DoF is moved, so is the constaint that accompanies it. Clearly, this will lead to a different ‘boundary condition’ on the component, and so all elements of the impedance matrix will be modified. Similarly, if a new DoF is added, a new constraint is introduced and again, all elements of the impedance matrix will be modified. The same is not true, however, for the mobility FRF; moving or adding a DoF only alters the external force constraint, which has no effect on the component’s boundary conditions. Hence, the elements of the FRF matrix are unchanged.",

    "text": "Degrees of freedom\nHaving introduced the general concept of a multi-DoF FRF matrix, the building block of a VAVP, we are now ready to discus what FRFs are required to characterise completely the passive properties of a component. There are two main talking points here: the first conearns the nature of the FRF’s excitation and response; the second concearns where on a component should FRFs be measured.\nIn the preceeding discussion we made no specific mention of the type of forces or responses (their direction or whether they are translational or rotational) in our defintion of the FRF. These are important considerations when representing a component by an FRF matrix. Failure to caputure a correct set of FRFs will lead to a poorly characterised component, and put the entire VAVP at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of the DoFs for source and receiver components; the interface DoFs \\(c\\) (for source and receiver) and the target DoFs \\(r\\) (receiver only).\n\n\n\nThe FRFs required to characterise a component depend firstly on the type of component, whether it is a vibration source, a coupling element, or a recevier-like structure. Following the black-box approach described earlier, a component can be characterised entirely by a set of input-output (FRF) relations at and between its structural connections (interfaces), in addition to any extra remote positions that are of interest. For a vibration source, there is typically no interest in the remote response away from the interface; the source FRFs include only the interface DoFs \\(c\\). Coupling elements are designed to couple two (or more) components, and so they have least two distinct interfaces, e.g. above and below a vibration isolator. There is generally no interest in the element’s response inbetween these interfaces and so, like the vibration source, the coupling element FRFs include only the interface DoFs \\(c_1, \\, c_2\\). Recevier-like components differ from the above. In addition to the interface \\(c\\), there are typically a series of additional target locations \\(r\\) that are of interest; these are the usually the locations at which we would like to make a response prediction using the VAVP. They might be structural or acoustic.\n\nSource components\nLets begin by considering the source FRF matrix in the case of \\(N\\) discrete connections points. The motion of any `point’ on a structural component is in general described by 6 DoFs - 3 translations in the \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) coordinates, and a rotation about each of these axes, respectively, \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\). We term these DoFs ‘rigid body’ or ‘point-like’ DoFs. Of course, the notion of a point is an idealisation describing an infinesimally small area, which a structural connection point is clearly not. Nevertheless, if the structural wavelength (which depends on frequnecy) is large compared to the size of the connection, then locally the dynamics behave point-like and can be described entirely by the rigid body DoFs. It is imperitive when building a VAVP that all point-like DoFs are considered (at least initially); very rarely does structual forcing or coupling occur in a single translational direction with no rotations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that as frequency increases, and structural wave length decreases, local deformations will begin to occur over the connection. At this point the interface dynamics are longer behaving point-like and an alternative ‘flexible’ or ‘continuous’ representation is required. This topic will be discussed later in the context of the Virtual Point transformation in Interfaces.\n\n\nSo, a source with \\(N\\) interface connections is characterised by \\(6N\\) point-like DoFs such that its complete FRF matrix \\(\\mathbf{Y}_S\\in\\mathbb{C}^{6N\\times6N}\\), is given by, \\[\n            \\mathbf{Y}_{Scc} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c}\\mathbf{Y}_{Sc_1c_1} & \\mathbf{Y}_{Sc_1c_2} & \\cdots & \\mathbf{Y}_{Sc_1c_N}\\\\\n        \\mathbf{Y}_{Sc_2c_1} & \\mathbf{Y}_{Sc_2c_2} & \\cdots & \\mathbf{Y}_{Sc_2c_N}\\\\\n        \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\\n        \\mathbf{Y}_{Sc_Nc_1} & \\mathbf{Y}_{Sc_Nc_2} & \\cdots & \\mathbf{Y}_{Sc_Nc_N}\n    \\end{array}\\right]\n\\tag{8}\\] where the capitalised sub-script \\(S\\) clarifies that the FRF belongs to the source in isolation, and the lower case sub-scripts \\(cc\\) that the excitation and reponse positions are co-located at the interface DoFs \\(c\\). In general, \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Sc_ic_j}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{6\\times 6}\\) is a FRF sub-matrix relating the translational and rotational forces at the \\(j\\)th interface connection to the corresponding response at the \\(i\\)th. Explicitly, \\[\n    \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n        v_{x_i} \\\\ v_{y_i} \\\\ v_{z_i} \\\\ v_{\\alpha_i}\\\\ v_{\\beta_i}\\\\ v_{\\gamma_i}\n    \\end{array}\\right)=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccccc} Y_{{x_ix_j}} & Y_{{x_iy_j}} & Y_{{x_iz_j}} & Y_{{x_i\\alpha_j}} & Y_{{x_i\\beta_j}} & Y_{{x_i\\gamma_j}} \\\\\n        Y_{{y_ix_j}} & Y_{{y_iy_j}} & Y_{{y_iz_j}} & Y_{{y_i\\alpha_j}} & Y_{{y_i\\beta_j}} & Y_{{y_i\\gamma_j}} \\\\\n        Y_{{z_ix_j}} & Y_{{z_iy_j}} & Y_{{z_iz_j}} & Y_{{z_i\\alpha_j}} & Y_{{z_i\\beta_j}} & Y_{{z_i\\gamma_j}} \\\\\n        Y_{{\\alpha_i x_j}} & Y_{{\\alpha_i y_j}} & Y_{{\\alpha_i z_j}} & Y_{{\\alpha_i\\alpha_j}} & Y_{{\\alpha_i\\beta_j}} & Y_{{\\alpha_i\\gamma_j}} \\\\\n        Y_{{\\beta_i x_j}} & Y_{{\\beta_i y_j}} & Y_{{\\beta_i z_j}} & Y_{{\\beta_i\\alpha_j}} & Y_{{\\beta_i\\beta_j}} & Y_{{\\beta_i\\gamma_j}}\\\\\n        Y_{{\\gamma_i x_j}} & Y_{{\\gamma_i y_j}} & Y_{{\\gamma_i z_j}} & Y_{{\\gamma_i\\alpha_j}} & Y_{{\\gamma_i\\beta_j}} & Y_{{\\gamma_i\\gamma_j}}\n    \\end{array}\\right]\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n        f_{x_j} \\\\ f_{y_j} \\\\ f_{z_j} \\\\ f_{\\alpha_j}\\\\ f_{\\beta_j}\\\\ f_{\\gamma_j}\n    \\end{array}\\right)\n\\tag{9}\\] where, for example, \\(Y_{{\\alpha_i y_j}}\\) is the FRF relating a translational force in the \\(y\\) direction at position \\(j\\) to a rotational response about the \\(x\\)-axis at position \\(i\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn practice, not all DoFs are necessary at all points. In fact, in some scenarios including a DoF that does not contirbute significantly to forcing or coupling can actually worsen the performance of a VAVP. For this reason, perhaps the greatest challenge when building a VAVP is correctly identifying which DoFs are required (which depends on frequency by the way!) to characterise a component sufficiently without introducing unecessary error and uncertainty.\n\n\nAt this point it is important to recognise that whilst the full \\(6N\\) DoF matrix described above is theoretically important, FRF matrices are rarely measured in this form. The \\(6N\\) DoFs above describe a component’s motion in terms of the translations and rotations about a series of idealised point-like connections. In practice, it is not usually possible to directly measure translational and rotational motions for co-located excitation and response positions, nor is it straightforward to measure rotational motions directly. Rather, we measure a set of translational FRFs between \\(N\\) excitation positions surrounding point \\(j\\), and \\(M\\) response positions surrounding point \\(i\\), in the form, \\[\n    \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n        v_{1} \\\\ v_{2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_{M}\n    \\end{array}\\right)_i = \\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c}Y_{11} & Y_{12} & \\cdots & Y_{1N}\\\\\n        Y_{11} & Y_{22} & \\cdots & Y_{2N}\\\\\n        \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\\n        Y_{M1} & Y_{M2} & \\cdots & Y_{MN}\\\\\n    \\end{array}\\right]_{ij} \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n        f_{1} \\\\ f_{2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ f_{N}\n    \\end{array}\\right)_j.\n\\tag{10}\\] An example illustrated in Figure 3, where for clarity we consider collocated points, \\(i=j\\).\nWhilst directly measured FRF matrices in the form of Equation 10 can be used for some forms of analysis, due to their non-co-located excitation and response positions and lack of rotations, they are limited in terms of VAVP development.\nFrom Equation 10, provided the measured FRF matrix spans the vector space of the full point-like \\(6\\) DoF matrix (Equation 9), the latter can be determined by applying an appropriate rigid body transformation, \\[\n    \\left[\\begin{array}{cccccc} Y_{{x_ix_j}} & Y_{{x_iy_j}} & Y_{{x_iz_j}} & Y_{{x_i\\alpha_j}} & Y_{{x_i\\beta_j}} & Y_{{x_i\\gamma_j}} \\\\\n        Y_{{y_ix_j}} & Y_{{y_iy_j}} & Y_{{y_iz_j}} & Y_{{y_i\\alpha_j}} & Y_{{y_i\\beta_j}} & Y_{{y_i\\gamma_j}} \\\\\n        Y_{{z_ix_j}} & Y_{{z_iy_j}} & Y_{{z_iz_j}} & Y_{{z_i\\alpha_j}} & Y_{{z_i\\beta_j}} & Y_{{z_i\\gamma_j}} \\\\\n        Y_{{\\alpha_i x_j}} & Y_{{\\alpha_i y_j}} & Y_{{\\alpha_i z_j}} & Y_{{\\alpha_i\\alpha_j}} & Y_{{\\alpha_i\\beta_j}} & Y_{{\\alpha_i\\gamma_j}} \\\\\n        Y_{{\\beta_i x_j}} & Y_{{\\beta_i y_j}} & Y_{{\\beta_i z_j}} & Y_{{\\beta_i\\alpha_j}} & Y_{{\\beta_i\\beta_j}} & Y_{{\\beta_i\\gamma_j}}\\\\\n        Y_{{\\gamma_i x_j}} & Y_{{\\gamma_i y_j}} & Y_{{\\gamma_i z_j}} & Y_{{\\gamma_i\\alpha_j}} & Y_{{\\gamma_i\\beta_j}} & Y_{{\\gamma_i\\gamma_j}}\n    \\end{array}\\right]= \\mathbf{T}_r\\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c}Y_{11} & Y_{12} & \\cdots & Y_{1N}\\\\\n        Y_{11} & Y_{22} & \\cdots & Y_{2N}\\\\\n        \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\\n        Y_{M1} & Y_{M2} & \\cdots & Y_{MN}\\\\\n    \\end{array}\\right]_{ij} \\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm T}\n\\] where \\(\\mathbf{T}_{r,f}\\) are the transformation matrices for response and force positions, respectively. Further details on the construction of \\(\\mathbf{T}_{r,f}\\) are given in Interfaces. Hereafter, we will assume (unless otherwise stated) that any FRF matrices introduced have been transformed in such a way that they relate translational/rotational DoFs, as described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Illustration of ‘transformed’ (left) vs. ‘measured’ (right) FRFs. Measured FRFs related a set of discrete non-co-located forces and responses surrounding a connection point. Transformed FRFs relate the co-located forces and moments to the translational and rotational responses at a particular point.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecevier components\nLet us now consider the DoFs of a matching reciever structure (as in Figure 2). As a matching component, we have the same number of interface connections but now with an aditional set of remote \\(r\\) DoFs. Consequently, the recevier FRF takes the form, \\[\n    \\mathbf{Y}_{R} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c c}\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc} & \\mathbf{Y}_{Rcr}\\\\\n        \\mathbf{Y}_{Rrc} & \\mathbf{Y}_{Rrr}\n    \\end{array}\\right]\n\\] where: the FRF submatrix \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc}\\) is identical in form to that of Equation 8 (i.e. including \\(N\\) sub-FRF matrices, one for each connection point); \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Rrc}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcr}\\) are the transfer FRFs between the interface and remote DoFs; and \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Rrr}\\) is the point FRF matrix for the remote DoFs. If the remote points are acoustic in nature (say if we wish to predict the sound pressure level within a vehicle cabin), we use instead vibro-acoustic FRF matrices as, \\[\n    \\mathbf{Y}_{R} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c c}\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc} & \\mathbf{H}_{Rcr}\\\\\n        \\mathbf{H}_{Rrc} & \\mathbf{H}_{Rrr}\n    \\end{array}\\right]\n\\] In this case \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{R}\\) isnt strictly speaking a structural FRF matrix anymore, rather its a mixed vibro-acoustic FRF matrix. Nevertheless we use the same notation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe vibro-acoustic FRF matrix \\(\\mathbf{H}_{Rcr}\\) relates a volume velocity excitation at \\(r\\) to the structura response at \\(c\\). Similary, \\(\\mathbf{H}_{Rrc}\\) relates a structural force excitation at \\(c\\) to an acoustic pressure response at \\(r\\). Finally, \\(\\mathbf{H}_{Rrr}\\) is a purely acoustic FRF matrix that relates a volume velocity excitation at \\(r\\) to its co-located pressure response.\n\n\nUnlike the interface connections, which generaly need to include all 6 point-like DoFs (translations and rotations about each axis), the remote points \\(r\\) need only include the DoFs for which prediction is sought. Most often this is just the outward normal response and some set of locations, or perhaps a sound pressure level at some listener position. Moreover, if these remote points are soley for prediction, i.e. no external forcing or coupling is to be applied there, then only one of the transfer FRFs is required, and the remote point FRF can be discarded entirely. This reduces the recevier FRF to, \\[\n    \\mathbf{Y}_{R} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c c}\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc} \\\\\n        \\mathbf{Y}_{Rrc}\n    \\end{array}\\right] \\qquad \\mbox{or} \\qquad  \\left[\\begin{array}{c c}\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc} \\\\\n        \\mathbf{H}_{Rrc}\n    \\end{array}\\right]\n\\] This reduction can drastically simplify the measurement of \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{R}\\), especialy for the vibro-acoustic case.\n\n\nCoupling elements\nFor a coupling elements, such as a vibration isolator, we typically have two sets of interface DoFs; those above the element (\\(c_1\\)) and those below (\\(c_2\\)). As above, at each of these interfaces all point-like DoFs should be accounted for. This leads to an FRF matric \\(\\mathbf{Y}_I\\in\\mathbb{C}^{12\\times 12}\\) of the form, \\[\n    \\mathbf{Y}_{I} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c c}\\mathbf{Y}_{Ic_1c_1} & \\mathbf{Y}_{Ic_1c_2}\\\\\n        \\mathbf{Y}_{Ic_2c_1} & \\mathbf{Y}_{Ic_2c_2}\n    \\end{array}\\right]\n\\] where \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Ic_1c_1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Ic_1c_1}\\) are the point FRFs above and below the element, respectively, and \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{Ic_1c_2}=\\mathbf{Y}_{Ic_2c_1}^{\\rm T}\\) are the transfer FRFs from one side to the other.\n\n\nSummary\nIn summary of this section, the passive characterisation of source, recevier and coupling components is acheived by the following FRF matrices, \\[\n    \\mathbf{Y}_{S} = \\mathbf{Y}_{Scc}\\qquad \\mathbf{Y}_{R} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c c}\\mathbf{Y}_{Rcc} \\\\\n        \\mathbf{Y}_{Rrc}\n    \\end{array}\\right] \\qquad \\mbox{and} \\qquad \\mathbf{Y}_{I} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c c}\\mathbf{Y}_{Ic_1c_1} & \\mathbf{Y}_{Ic_1c_2}\\\\\n        \\mathbf{Y}_{Ic_2c_1} & \\mathbf{Y}_{Ic_2c_2}\n    \\end{array}\\right]\n\\] where \\(c\\) is set to include all point-like DoFs across the interface, \\(r\\) is a specific subset of DoFs that we wish to make predictions for, and \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) include all point-like DoFs above and below the coupling element, respectively.",

    "text": "Boundary conditions\nCentral to the VAVP framework is notion of an independent characteristion of each component by its (multi-DoF) FRF matrix. In the above we introduced general concept of multi-DoF FRFs, discussed what DoFs are required for each component type, but as yet we have made no comment on how to ensure that these FRF matrices are independent, in partiuclar when obtained by experiment. This a comes down to boundary conditions.\nTo ensure that a measured FRF matrix is an invariant property it should be obtained with the component in ‘isolation’. To achieve this, the preferred test arrangement is with a ‘free-interface’ condition under either a grounded support or a free boundary condition, as discussed below and illustrated in. For this latter case, we are particularly interested in the design of an appropriate resilient support system and, where necessary, a method for removing its effect from measured FRFs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrounded support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Illustration of the free and grounded supports for independent characterisation of source and recevier-like components\n\n\n\n\nGrounded support\nReceiver-like components are often such that they will naturally be supported by the ground, for example the body of a vehicle or the fabric of a building. In this case, to obtain an independent FRF, it is sufficient to ensure that the component is supported in a manner representative of its intended application, and that the interface to which any components will be attached is left free. In a sense, we are simply considering the grounded support to be part of the component.\n\n\nFree suspension\nFor components that are to be entirely supported by other components (for example, most vibration sources), a ‘free’ boundary condition is required to obtain an indeopendent FRF. This clearly presents some practical issues and only an approximately free boundary can be achieved in practice. This is typically done by suspending the component from resilient cabling (e.g. elastic bungees) or by mounting it on a sufficiently resilient support. This support system should be designed such that its impedance is as small as possible (while providing adequate structural support for the component) so that the measured coupled FRF approximates that of the free component.\nThe added support will ultimately lead to low frequency mass-spring-like resonances where the enitre component bounces around as a rigid body. A suitable support scheme should see these resonant frequencies positioned well below the lowest frequency of interest. Some practical guidence on acheiving this is given in ISO 9611 and ISO 7626.\n\n\nIn situ\nIn some cases, a resilient support is simply not possible as the component must be mounted to a more supportive structure to operate, such as a test bench. In this scenario one must resort to a more advanced indirect method of obtaining the component’s free-interface FRF; this involves mathematically decoupling the component from a known test bench. This sort of decoupling procedure is fraught with difficulty, and should generally be avoided if possible. A similar problem arrises when considering the characterisation of coupling element’s, as described below.\nTo measure the free-interface FRF matrix of a coupling element one would have to freely suspend the element (say from elastic bungees), instrument its two interfaces and then apply the necessary force excitations… There are a number of practical issues with this:\n\ncoupling elements are generally quite light weight, and so to have a minimal effect on the measured FRFs the suspension used would have to be incredibly compliant;\nthere is usually limited space to insturment and subsequently excite either end; even if this were possible, the compliant suspension would lead to very large rigid body motions;\ncoupling elements are often sensitive to pre-load and installation effects, which are not caputured when freely suspended.\n\nClearly, we are unable to characterise coupling elements by the same methods as source and recevier components, i.e. by their free interface FRF matrices. Instead, measurements must be made with the element in situ, i.e. installed in some assembely. This installation provides not only a means on instrumenting and exciting the element, but also necessayr pre-load. The challange then becomes, how to extract independent component data from measurements made on an assembly. For coupling elements, this issue will be dealt with in detail in Vibration isolators..",

Once we have dealt with coupling elements, we will have everything we need to build a coupled assembly model by means of substructuring.\nHowever, before we get onto isolators we need to take a very important detour to discuss Interface representations. How we describe an interfaces in terms of a finite number of DoFs (e.g. point-like translations and rotations), and how we obtain these DoF from measurement, is central to any component-level characterisation, both passive and active.

    "text": "Single point interfaces\nIn physical assemblies, a range of contact types occur, often comprising bolted connections, spot welds, among other fixings. When modeling connections, we encounter the problem that the real contact always occurs over a finite area; this ‘continuous’ form must be reduced to a ‘discrete’ form to be compatible with our FRF-based VAVP framework. When the contact is physically small compared with the structural wavelength we can treat the connection simply as a discreet point. The point-like* connection is the most commonly adopted model when building a VAVP (or at least the most common starting point). It is described entirely by the 6 rigid interface DoFs; translations in \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\), and rotations about each of these axes; \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\). For interfaces that extend over more than a fraction of a wavelength, this point-like model is no longer sufficient and some form of higher order model is required.\nRepresenting contact geometry is only part of the story however – the overarching aim of an interface model is to capture all important dynamics occuring at the interface. Whilst 6 DoFs might be sufficient for a point-like connection, it is often not known if the physical connection satisfies the point-like requirements aprior. Indeed, higher order ‘flexible’ DoFs might be required to sufficiently caputre the interface dynamics. This raises the important questions of a) how many DoFs are necessary to describe the interface and b) which ones they are. Later we will introduce the concept of interface completeness as a means of addressing these questions.\nHaving chosen a suitable representation of the contact, we must somehow populate it with data obtained from measurement. The VAVP framework requires that the interface representations of connected components must be compatible; component FRFs (and blocked forces) at an interface must share a matching set of DoFs to be coupled successfully. Unfortunately, practical limitations such as lack of access, mean that the required DoFs cannot usually be measured directly. Therefore, the measured data must be transformed from measurement coordinates to those of the interface model. An important concept then is is that of interface transformations.\n\nTransformation of measured FRFs\nThe idea of an interface transformation is quite general and by no means limited to the point-like representation. In short, it is the process of populating an interface model (a chosen set of co-located DoFs that are thought to best describe the physical interface) with data obtained from a set of translational-only FRF measurements that surround the connection point. We will use the point-like interface as a means of introducing the concept; generalistion to more complex representations will become obvious later.\nA single point-like interface is characterised by 6 DoFs; the translational \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) DoFs, and their respective rotations \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\). The equation governing the 6 DoF motion of a single point interface (left of Figure 1) is then, \\[\n    \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n        v_{x} \\\\ v_{y} \\\\ v_{z} \\\\ v_{\\alpha}\\\\ v_{\\beta}\\\\ v_{\\gamma}\n    \\end{array}\\right)=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccccc} Y_{{xx}} & Y_{{xy}} & Y_{{xz}} & Y_{{x\\alpha}} & Y_{{x\\beta}} & Y_{{x\\gamma}} \\\\\n        Y_{{yx}} & Y_{{yy}} & Y_{{yz}} & Y_{{y\\alpha}} & Y_{{y\\beta}} & Y_{{y\\gamma}} \\\\\n        Y_{{zx}} & Y_{{zy}} & Y_{{zz}} & Y_{{z\\alpha}} & Y_{{z\\beta}} & Y_{{z\\gamma}} \\\\\n        Y_{{\\alpha x}} & Y_{{\\alpha y}} & Y_{{\\alpha z}} & Y_{{\\alpha\\alpha}} & Y_{{\\alpha\\beta}} & Y_{{\\alpha\\gamma}} \\\\\n        Y_{{\\beta x}} & Y_{{\\beta y}} & Y_{{\\beta z}} & Y_{{\\beta\\alpha}} & Y_{{\\beta\\beta}} & Y_{{\\beta\\gamma}}\\\\\n        Y_{{\\gamma x}} & Y_{{\\gamma y}} & Y_{{\\gamma z}} & Y_{{\\gamma\\alpha}} & Y_{{\\gamma\\beta}} & Y_{{\\gamma\\gamma}}\n    \\end{array}\\right]\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n        f_{x} \\\\ f_{y} \\\\ f_{z} \\\\ f_{\\alpha}\\\\ f_{\\beta}\\\\ f_{\\gamma}\n    \\end{array}\\right)\n\\] where for example \\(v_\\alpha\\) is the rotational response (say velocity) about the \\(x\\) axis, \\(f_\\gamma\\) is the moment force about the \\(z\\) axis, and \\(Y_{\\alpha\\gamma}\\) is the transfer FRF relating the two.\nRotational DoFs are generally not available by direct measurement (though rotational response sensors are available, their use is not very common). Even the direct measurement of a translational point FRF (e.g. \\(Y_{xx}\\)) is challenging; requiring an exact co-location of the applied force and measured response. In practice, to overcome these challenges it is typical to measure a series of translational FRFs surrounding the interface connection and through an appropriate transformation, use these to estimate the translational and rotational DoFs of interest.\nThe matrix of measured FRFs (right of Figure 1) satisfies the equation, \\[\n    \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n        v_{1} \\\\ v_{2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_{N_v}\n    \\end{array}\\right) = \\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c}Y_{11} & Y_{12} & \\cdots & Y_{1N_f}\\\\\n        Y_{11} & Y_{22} & \\cdots & Y_{2N_f}\\\\\n        \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\\n        Y_{N_v1} & Y_{N_v2} & \\cdots & Y_{N_vN_f}\\\\\n    \\end{array}\\right]  \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n        f_{1} \\\\ f_{2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ f_{N_f}\n    \\end{array}\\right)\n\\] or \\[\n\\mathbf{\\hat{v}} = \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}\\mathbf{\\hat{f}}\n\\tag{1}\\] where: \\(v_n\\) and \\(f_n\\) are, respectively, the response and applied force at the \\(n\\)th ; \\(N_v\\) and \\(N_f\\) denote the number of measured responses and applied forces, respectively; and the \\(\\hat{\\square}\\) accent is used to denote a measured quantity, as opposed to a transformed one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of ‘transformed’ (left) vs. ‘measured’ (right) FRFs. Measured FRFs related a set of discrete non-co-located forces and responses surrounding a connection point. Transformed FRFs relate the co-located forces and moments to the translational and rotational responses at a particular point.\n\n\n\nAssuming an entirely rigid interface, such that only translational and rotational motions are permitted, the set of measured translational responses \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N_v}\\) can be related to a set of mixed translational/rotational responses \\(\\mathbf{v}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{6}\\) (provided \\(N_v\\geq 6\\)) defined at some other location according to the linear transformation, \\[\n        \\mathbf{{v}} = \\mathbf{T}_v \\mathbf{\\hat{v}}\n\\tag{2}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{T}_v\\in\\mathbb{C}^{6 \\times N_v}\\) is the so-called response transformation matrix.\nSimilarly, the set of applied (translational) forces \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{f}}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N_f}\\) can be thought to generate a mixed set of translational and rotational forces \\(\\mathbf{{f}}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{6}\\) at some other location, again according to a linear transformation, \\[\n        \\mathbf{f} = \\mathbf{R}_f^{\\rm T} \\mathbf{\\hat{f}} \\quad \\mbox{or} \\quad  \\mathbf{\\hat{f}} = \\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm T} \\mathbf{f}\n\\tag{3}\\] with \\(\\mathbf{T}_f^{} = \\mathbf{R}_f^{\\rm+} \\in\\mathbb{C}^{N_f \\times 6}\\) as the so-called force transformation matrix.\nSubstituting Equation 2 and Equation 3 into Equation 1 we obtain, \\[\n        \\mathbf{{v}} = \\mathbf{T}_v \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}\\mathbf{\\hat{f}} = \\overbrace{\\mathbf{T}_v \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}} \\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm T} }^{\\mathbf{Y}}\\mathbf{f}\n\\tag{4}\\] which is a relation between the transformed force and response vectors. The matrix product \\(\\mathbf{Y}=\\mathbf{T}_v \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}} \\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm T}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{6\\times 6}\\) thus describes the transformed FRF matrix or equivalently, the FRF matrix projected onto the chosen interface model. \\[\n    \\left[\\begin{array}{cccccc} Y_{{x_ix_j}} & Y_{{x_iy_j}} & Y_{{x_iz_j}} & Y_{{x_i\\alpha_j}} & Y_{{x_i\\beta_j}} & Y_{{x_i\\gamma_j}} \\\\\n        Y_{{y_ix_j}} & Y_{{y_iy_j}} & Y_{{y_iz_j}} & Y_{{y_i\\alpha_j}} & Y_{{y_i\\beta_j}} & Y_{{y_i\\gamma_j}} \\\\\n        Y_{{z_ix_j}} & Y_{{z_iy_j}} & Y_{{z_iz_j}} & Y_{{z_i\\alpha_j}} & Y_{{z_i\\beta_j}} & Y_{{z_i\\gamma_j}} \\\\\n        Y_{{\\alpha_i x_j}} & Y_{{\\alpha_i y_j}} & Y_{{\\alpha_i z_j}} & Y_{{\\alpha_i\\alpha_j}} & Y_{{\\alpha_i\\beta_j}} & Y_{{\\alpha_i\\gamma_j}} \\\\\n        Y_{{\\beta_i x_j}} & Y_{{\\beta_i y_j}} & Y_{{\\beta_i z_j}} & Y_{{\\beta_i\\alpha_j}} & Y_{{\\beta_i\\beta_j}} & Y_{{\\beta_i\\gamma_j}}\\\\\n        Y_{{\\gamma_i x_j}} & Y_{{\\gamma_i y_j}} & Y_{{\\gamma_i z_j}} & Y_{{\\gamma_i\\alpha_j}} & Y_{{\\gamma_i\\beta_j}} & Y_{{\\gamma_i\\gamma_j}}\n    \\end{array}\\right]= \\mathbf{T}_v\\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c}Y_{11} & Y_{12} & \\cdots & Y_{1N}\\\\\n        Y_{11} & Y_{22} & \\cdots & Y_{2N}\\\\\n        \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\\n        Y_{M1} & Y_{M2} & \\cdots & Y_{MN}\\\\\n    \\end{array}\\right] \\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm T}\n\\tag{5}\\]\nConstruction of the transformation matrices \\(\\mathbf{T}_{v,f}\\) depends on the chosen interface representation. Examples include the finite different approxiamtion, discrete Fourier transform (for continuous interfaces), among others. In what follows we will consider the particular case of the Virtual Point transformation, which has become the most widely used representation in the contet of source characterisation, substrucutring and VAVP development.\nRegardless of the approach taken, the interpretation of Equation 5 remains the same. Pre-multiplication by \\(\\mathbf{T}_v\\) is an operation that acts on the measured response DoFs (i.e. the rows of the FRF matrix), projecting them onto the DoFs of the interface model. Similarly, post-multiplication by \\(\\mathbf{T}_f\\) acts to project the applied force DoFs (i.e. columns of the FRF matrix) onto the DoFs of interface model. They take the general form shown in Figure 2,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: General form of interface transformation matrix. Rows correspond to DoFs of the chosen interface model.

    "text": "Virtual point transormation\nThe Virtual Point (VP) transformation is a rigid body kinematic projection that relates a set of arbitrarily positioned (translational) response sensors and excitation forces, to the translational and rotational dynamics of a user defined Virtual Point (VP).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Example relative coordinates for virtual point transformations. Left - response transformation. Right - force transformation.\n\n\n\nIf we assume that, locally, an interface connection behaves rigidly (i.e. behaves point-like), the translational response of an arbitrary sensor \\(\\hat{v}_n\\in\\mathbb{C}\\) can be expressed in terms of the combined translational and rotational motion of a virtual point \\(\\mathbf{v}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{6}\\) as, \\[\n    \\hat{v}_n = \\overbrace{\\left[\\begin{array}{c c c} e_x & e_y & e_z \\end{array} \\right]}^{\\mathbf{e}_m}\n    \\overbrace{\\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c c c} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & r_z & -r_y \\\\\n    0 & 1 & 0 & -r_z & 0 & r_x\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & r_y & -r_x & 0\\end{array} \\right]}^{\\mathbf{r}_m}\\left(\\begin{array}{c} v_x \\\\ v_y \\\\ v_z \\\\ v_{\\alpha} \\\\ v_{\\beta} \\\\ v_{\\gamma}  \\end{array} \\right) +\\epsilon = \\mathbf{R}_{v_m}\\mathbf{v}+\\epsilon\n\\tag{6}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Orientation vector \\(\\mathbf{e}\\) from spherical coordinates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Orientation vector \\(\\mathbf{e}\\) from cross-product.\n\n\n\n\nIn the above, \\(\\mathbf{R}_{v_n}\\) represents a pair of linear transformations that account for the position and orientation of the sensor relative to the virtual point, or more precisely its coordinate system. The rightmost matrix \\(\\mathbf{r}_n\\) is the so-called Interface Deformation Mode (IDM) matrix that projects the motion of the VP onto the position of the sensor. The first three columns, which together form an identity matrix, simply state that an \\(x\\), \\(y\\), or \\(z\\) translation of the VP will yield identical translation of the measurement position. The remaining three columns describe how a rotational about each axis of the VP will induce a translation in the \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) coordinates of the measurement position. The magnitude of the resulting translation clearly depend on the relative distance (in meters) between the VP and measurement position, described in the \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) directions as \\(r_x\\), \\(r_y\\) and \\(r_z\\). The further away the VP and measurement position, the greater the translation will be from a given rotation.\nThe vector \\(\\mathbf{e}_n\\) then accounts for the orientation of the sensor, which may or may not be inline with the coordinate system used by the VP. Suppose for example the sensor is pointing vertically upwards in the \\(z\\) direction of the VP. The orientation vector would then be, \\[\n    \\mathbf{e}_z = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n    0&0&1\n    \\end{array}\\right].\n\\] More generally, the orientation vector can be determined from the sensor’s inclination and azimuthial angles as in Figure 4, \\[\n    \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} e_x & e_y & e_z \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc\n    } \\sin\\theta \\cos \\phi  & \\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi & \\cos \\theta \\end{array} \\right]\n\\] or obtained from a CAD model using the normalised cross-product between two vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) that define the orientation of the surface to which the sensor is attached, \\[\n    \\mathbf{e} = \\frac{\\mathbf{a}\\times \\mathbf{b}}{||\\mathbf{a}|| \\cdot ||\\mathbf{b}||}\n\\] as in Figure 5.\nThe final term in Equation 6, \\(\\epsilon\\), represents the component of the response \\(\\hat{v}_n\\) that can not be reproduced by the virtual point with its underlying rigid assumption. This can be considered a residual flexibility.\nEquation 6 can be written for each sensor, leading to the system of equations, \\[\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n  \\hat{v}_1 \\\\\n  \\hat{v}_2 \\\\\n  \\vdots \\\\\n  \\hat{v}_{N_v}\n\\end{array}\\right) = \\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c}\n\\mathbf{e}_1 & & &\\\\ & \\mathbf{e}_2 & &\\\\\n& & \\ddots & \\\\\n& & & \\mathbf{e}_{N_v}\n\\end{array} \\right] \\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{r}_1 \\\\ \\mathbf{r}_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{r}_M \\end{array}\\right]\\left(\\begin{array}{c} v_x \\\\ v_y \\\\ v_z \\\\ v_{\\alpha} \\\\ v_{\\beta} \\\\ v_{\\gamma}  \\end{array} \\right) +  \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\epsilon_1 \\\\\n\\epsilon_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\epsilon_{N_v}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\tag{7}\\] or simply \\[\n    \\mathbf{\\hat{v}} = \\mathbf{R}_v\\mathbf{v}+ \\mathbf{\\epsilon}\n\\tag{8}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}\\) is a vector of measured (translation) responses, and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the vector of translational and rotational responses at the virtual point.\nWhen using the VP transformation, it is particularly convenient to use tri-axial accelerometers, as in this case, the accelerometer responses recorded in \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) are done so at (approx.) the same location, and so they share \\(r_x\\), \\(r_y\\) and \\(r_z\\). For a single tri-axial sensor, Equation 6 then becomes, \\[\n    \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\hat{v}_{x,n}\\\\\n\\hat{v}_{y,n}\\\\\n\\hat{v}_{z,n}\n\\end{array}\\right) = \\overbrace{\\left[\\begin{array}{c c c} e_{x,x} & e_{x,y} & e_{x,z} \\\\\ne_{y,x} & e_{y,y} & e_{y,z}\\\\\ne_{z,x} & e_{z,y} & e_{z,z}\\end{array} \\right]}^{\\mathbf{E}_n}\n    \\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c c c} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & r_z & -r_y \\\\\n    0 & 1 & 0 & -r_z & 0 & r_x\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & r_y & -r_x & 0\\end{array} \\right]\\left(\\begin{array}{c} v_x \\\\ v_y \\\\ v_z \\\\ v_{\\alpha} \\\\ v_{\\beta} \\\\ v_{\\gamma}  \\end{array} \\right) +\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\\epsilon_{x,n}\\\\\n\\epsilon_{y,n}\\\\\n\\epsilon_{z,n}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\tag{9}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{E}_n\\) is now a matrix describing the orientation of the \\(n\\)th tri-axial sensor’s coordinate axes relative to that of the VP. For three tri-axial sensors (the minimum required to capture all 6 DoFs), Equation 7 becomes, \\[\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n  \\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_1 \\\\\n  \\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_2 \\\\\n  \\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_3\n\\end{array}\\right) = \\left[\\begin{array}{c c c}\n\\mathbf{E}_1 & &\\\\\n& \\mathbf{E}_2 &\\\\\n& & \\mathbf{E}_3\n\\end{array} \\right] \\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{r}_1 \\\\ \\mathbf{r}_2 \\\\ \\mathbf{r}_3 \\end{array}\\right]\\left(\\begin{array}{c} v_x \\\\ v_y \\\\ v_z \\\\ v_{\\alpha} \\\\ v_{\\beta} \\\\ v_{\\gamma}  \\end{array} \\right) +  \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\mathbf{\\epsilon}_1 \\\\\n\\mathbf{\\epsilon}_2 \\\\\n\\mathbf{\\epsilon}_3\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\] where \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_n\\in\\mathbb{C}^3\\) is the vector of tri-axial responses for sensor \\(n\\).\nWe can now apply a similar idea to the external forces. Application of an arbitrary external force \\(f_n\\) (at coordinates \\(r_x\\), \\(r_y\\), \\(r_z\\) relative to the VP) generates a set of translational and rotational forces at the VP. These forces are related by the equation, \\[\n    \\left(\\begin{array}{c} f_x \\\\ f_y \\\\ f_z \\\\ f_{\\alpha} \\\\ f_{\\beta} \\\\ f_{\\gamma}  \\end{array} \\right) =\n    \\overbrace{\\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c c c} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n        0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n        0 & 0& 1\\\\\n        0 & -r_z & r_y\\\\\n        r_z&0&-r_x\\\\\n        -r_y& r_x& 0\\end{array} \\right]}^{\\mathbf{r}_n^{\\rm T}} \\overbrace{\\left[\\begin{array}{c} e_x \\\\ e_y \\\\ e_z \\end{array} \\right]}^{\\mathbf{e}_n^{\\rm T}}  \\hat{f}_n =\\mathbf{R}^{\\rm T}_{f_n} \\hat{f}_n.\n\\] where \\(\\mathbf{R}^{\\rm T}_{f_n}\\) again represents a pair of linear transformations that account for the position and orientation of the applied force. An equation of this form can be written for each excitation, leading to, \\[\n    \\left(\\begin{array}{c} f_x \\\\ f_y \\\\ f_z \\\\ f_{\\alpha} \\\\ f_{\\beta} \\\\ f_{\\gamma}  \\end{array} \\right) =\n    \\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c c c} \\mathbf{r}_1^{\\rm T} & \\mathbf{r}_2^{\\rm T}  & \\cdots & \\mathbf{r}_{N_f}^{\\rm T} \\end{array} \\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc} \\mathbf{e}_1^{\\rm T} & & & \\\\ & \\mathbf{e}_2^{\\rm T}  & &\\\\\n& & \\ddots & \\\\ & & & \\mathbf{e}_{N_f}^{\\rm T} \\end{array} \\right]   \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n  \\hat{f}_1 \\\\\n  \\hat{f}_2 \\\\\n  \\vdots \\\\\n  \\hat{f}_{N_f}\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\] or simply \\[\n    \\mathbf{f} = \\mathbf{R}^{\\rm T}_f\\mathbf{\\hat{f}}\n\\] where \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{f}}\\) is a vector of applied/measured translation forces, and \\(\\mathbf{f}\\) is the vector of resulting translational and moment forces at the VP. Note that whilst tri-axial accelerometers can be used to simplify the VP response measurement, no equivalent is available for excitations. These must be applied individually.\nThrough a least squares pseudo-inverse, the above equations yield a pair of transformation matrices \\(\\mathbf{T}_v\\) and \\(\\mathbf{T}_f\\), \\[\n    \\mathbf{v} = \\left(\\mathbf{R}_v\\right)^+\\mathbf{\\hat{v}} = \\mathbf{T}_v\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}\n\\tag{10}\\] \\[\n    \\mathbf{\\hat{f}} = \\left(\\mathbf{R}^{\\rm T}_f\\right)^+\\mathbf{f} = \\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm T}\\mathbf{f}.  \n\\tag{11}\\]\nTo apply the VP transformation to a measured FRF matrix, \\[\n    \\mathbf{\\hat{v}} = \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}} \\mathbf{\\hat{f}}\n\\] we first substitute \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{f}}\\) from Equation 11, \\[\n    \\mathbf{\\hat{v}} = \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}} \\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm T}\\mathbf{f}\n\\tag{12}\\] before pre-multiplying both sides of Equation 12 by \\(\\mathbf{T}_v\\) to obtain, \\[\n    \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{T}_v\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}} \\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm T}\\mathbf{f}.\n\\tag{13}\\] Equation 13 takes the same form as Equation 4; it relates the VP transformed force \\(\\mathbf{f}\\) to the VP transformed response \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). As such, the matrix product must describe the VP transformed FRF matrix \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\), \\[\n    \\mathbf{Y} = \\mathbf{T}_v\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}\\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm T}.\n\\] As described earlier, pre and post-multiplying by \\(\\mathbf{T}_{v}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm T}\\) acts to project the measured FRF matrix \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}\\) onto the (VP) interface model. The projected FRF matrix \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) can now be used as part of any substructuring or source characterisation calculations.\nThe VP transformation has several advantages over the equivalent multi-point connection and finite difference approximation. Firstly, the translational and rotational DoFs of the VP are estimated based on the response of all sensors. This enables the over-determination of the problem, which can provide a more accurate estimate. A second advantage is that the resulting DoFs are exactly collocated at the VP. This is particularly useful when trying to combine measurements made on different components where all DoFs must be correctly aligned. This is also useful for combining measurements with models. The VP transformation has been extended further to include flexible interface modes (describe below), and rotational sensors.\nWhilst a powerful tool, the VP transformation has a notable disadvantage. It requires accurate information on both the position and orientation of each sensor and applied force (so to construct the transformation matrices \\(\\mathbf{T}_v\\) and \\(\\mathbf{T}_f\\)). If a CAD model of the interface is available this information may be readily obtained; without, the VP transformation might be subject to large uncertainties or simply not applicable.\n\nPerformance indicators\nThe VP transformations described above are based on the assumption that the interface can be described entirely by its rigid body dynamics. This is typically a valid assumption in the low/mid frequency range, where the structural wavelength is much larger than the size of the interface connection. However, as frequency increases so does the deformation of the interface and at higher frequencies there may be a need to assess the validity of the rigid body assumption.\nTransforming from a set of measured DoFs involves projecting \\(N_{v,f}\\geq 6\\) dimensional space representing the measurement DoFs (applied forces and measured responses), on to an \\(N=6\\) dimensional space representing the transformed rigid body DoFs (the interface model). In most cases, \\(N_{v,f}&gt; 6\\) and so this projection potentially involves the loss of information.\nIf the interface does in fact behave rigidly, then the rank of its measured FRF matrix \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_{cc}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N_v\\times N_f}\\) must be limited to 6. In this case, the interface transformations can be applied in reverse to reconstruct the original measured FRF matrix from the transformed matrix, \\[\n    \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}' = \\mathbf{T}_v^{+}\\,\\mathbf{{Y}}\\,\\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm +T} = \\mathbf{T}_v^{+}\\, \\left(\\mathbf{T}_v\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}\\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm T}\\right)\\,\\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm +T} = \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}} \\quad \\quad \\mbox{if} \\quad \\mbox{rank}\\left(\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}\\right) \\leq 6\n\\] where we use the \\(\\square'\\) accent to denote a reconstruction of the original FRF matrix.\nIf however, the interface possesses some flexibility, the rank of \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_{cc}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N_v\\times N_f}\\) has the potential to be greater than 6. In this case, the measured FRF matrix can only be reconstructed approximately, \\[\n    \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}' = \\mathbf{T}_v^{+}\\,\\mathbf{{Y}}\\,\\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm +T} = \\mathbf{T}_v^{+}\\, \\left(\\mathbf{T}_v\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}\\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm T}\\right)\\,\\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm +T} \\approx \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}  \\quad \\quad \\mbox{if} \\quad \\mbox{rank}\\left(\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}\\right) &gt; 6\n\\] Note that the reconstructed FRF matrix \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}'\\) includes only the rigid body dynamics; flexible interface dynamics in \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}\\) have been filtered out by applying the transformation followed by its inverse.\nIt is important to note that this action of ‘filtering out flexible dynamics’ implicitly requires an over-determined transformation with \\(N_{v,f}&gt;6\\). In the determined case the transformation matrix becomes square (\\(N_{v,f}=6\\)), and assuming its inverse exists, it is exactly reversible. In other words, there are not enough measurement DoFs to observe flexibility; the interface is ‘under sampled’.\nIn the over-determined case, the above notion can be used to establish sensor and force consistency criteria that indicate the validity of the rigid interface assumption, as well as the quality of the sensor arrangement and applied forces.\n\nSensor consistency\nTo assess the consistency of the sensor arrangement we consider a unit force \\(f_h = 1\\) applied to the component in question at the arbitrary position \\(h\\). The directly measured velocity response satisfies the equation, \\[\n    \\mathbf{\\hat{v}} = \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_h f_h = \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_h\n\\] where \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_h\\) is a column vector of measured mobilities between force position \\(h\\) and the interface responses. Similarly, the transformed velocity response satisfies, \\[\n    \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{Y}_h f_h = \\mathbf{Y}_h = \\mathbf{T}_v \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_h.\n\\] Applying the inverse transformation to the transformed velocity projects the response back onto the measured DoFs, \\[\n    \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_h' = \\mathbf{T}_v^+ \\mathbf{T}_v \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_h.\n\\] where \\(\\square'\\) is used to denote filtering of rigid body dynamics.\nThe matrix product \\(\\mathbf{T}_v^+ \\mathbf{T}_v\\) has the effect of filtering out flexible interface modes, retaining only the rigid body dynamics.\nThe sensor consistency can be assessed by simply comparing the directly measured \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}\\) and reconstructed (rigid body only) \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}'\\) responses. This comparison can be done in a variety of ways. A popular approach is to use a correlation-based measure of similarity, \\[\n    \\rho_{v,h} = \\mbox{Corr}\\left(\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_h,\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_h'\\right) \\qquad \\mbox{with} \\qquad\n    \\mbox{Corr}\\left(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}\\right) = \\frac{ \\left|\\mathbf{a}^{\\rm H}\\mathbf{b} \\right|^2 }{ \\mathbf{a}^{\\rm H} \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}^{\\rm H}\\mathbf{b}}\n\\tag{14}\\] The sensor consistency \\(\\rho_{v,h}\\) is a frequency dependent scalar quantity that varies between 0 and 1. A value of 1 indicates rigid interface behaviour, i.e. the reconstructed (rigid body filtered) responses are identical to those measured directly. A value less than 1 indicates some degree of interface flexibility, which is lost through the applied transformation.\nNote that \\(\\rho_{v,h}\\) is evaluated for the force excitation at position \\(h\\), and that multiple force locations might be considered. In this case each force could be used to determine an independent \\(\\rho_{v,h}\\). Alternatively, the collection of measured and reconstructed responses can be vectorized (i.e. stacked into a single large column vector, denoted by \\(\\mbox{Vec}({\\square})\\)) and used to determine an overall sensor consistency, \\[\n\\rho_v = \\mbox{Corr}\\left(\\mbox{Vec}({\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}}),\\mbox{Vec}({\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}')}\\right).\n\\]\nWhilst the location of the applied forces is, in theory arbitrary, it is recommended to avoid using the interface so as to ensure that a global response is generated, as opposed to a local response that might be highly sensitive to the impact position.\n\n\nForce consistency\nBased on the above sensor criterion, it is straightforward to develop an equivalent impact consistency criterion so as to assess the quality of the applied forces.\nIn this case consider the response of a single interface sensor to all of the forces applied around the interface, \\[\n    \\hat{v}_i = \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_i  \\mathbf{\\hat{f}}\n\\] where $ _i$ is a row vector of directly measured mobilities between the applied forces and sensor \\(i\\).\nSimilarly, the response at sensor \\(i\\) due to the rigid body filtered forces is given by, \\[\n    \\hat{v}_i' = \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_i \\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm T} \\mathbf{f} = \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_i \\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm T} \\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm +T}\\mathbf{\\hat{f}} = \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_i' \\mathbf{\\hat{f}}\n\\] where \\(\\square'\\) is now used to denote filtering of rigid body forces. The impact consistency is then defined as, \\[\n    \\rho_{f,i} = \\mbox{Corr}\\left(\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_i ,\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_i'\\right).\n\\] Like the sensor consistency, \\(\\rho_{f,i}\\) is bound between 0 and 1, with a value of 1 indicating perfect transmission of force between the applied impacts and the defined forces.\nTo obtain a single overall force consistency metric, we can again collect and vectorize the measured and reconstructed responses across all interface sensors, \\[\n\\rho_f = \\mbox{Corr}\\left(\\mbox{Vec}({\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}}),\\mbox{Vec}({\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}'})\\right).\n\\]\n\n\nCombined interface consistency\nHaving introduced the sensor and force consistency metrics above, it is perhaps obvious that one could formulate in the same manner a single overall consistency that combines the two. Indeed, applying both force and response transformations, alongside their respective inverses, one obtains the filtered FRF matrix, \\[\n\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}' = \\mathbf{T}_v^{+}\\, \\left(\\mathbf{T}_v\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}\\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm T}\\right)\\,\\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm +T}\n\\] which, by comparison against the original FRF matrix, forms an overall interface consistency metric, \\[\n\\rho = \\mbox{Corr}\\left(\\mbox{Vec}({\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}}),\\mbox{Vec}({\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}'})\\right).\n\\]",

Hence, it is necessary to extend this single-point treatment to the general multi-point case.\nFor the single-point interface, the full 6 DoF FRF matrix (see Equation 5) is obtained by, \\[\n\\mathbf{Y}=\\mathbf{T}_v\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}\\mathbf{T}_f^{\\rm T}\n\\tag{15}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}\\) is a matrix of measured translational mobilities, and \\(\\mathbf{T}_{v,f}\\) are a pair of transformation matrices. To extend this treatment to a multi-point case we simply note that a local interface model (i.e. a model pertaining to a single connection) depends only on the local measurement DoFs, i.e. those that surround the connection. Consequently, the transformed response and force DoFs of a multi-point interface are related to the measured response and force DoFs by, \\[\n    \\left(\\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{{v}}_{c_1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{{v}}_{c_N}\\end{array}\\right) = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\\mathbf{T}_{v,c_1} &  &   \\\\\n         &  \\ddots &  \\\\\n        &   & \\mathbf{T}_{v,c_N}  \\\\\n        \\end{array}\\right]\\left(\\begin{array}{c} \\hat{\\mathbf{v}}_{c_1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\hat{\\mathbf{v}}_{c_N}\\end{array}\\right)\n\\] and \\[        \\left(\\begin{array}{c} \\hat{\\mathbf{f}}_{c_1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\hat{\\mathbf{f}}_{c_N}\\end{array}\\right)\n         = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n        \\mathbf{T}^{\\rm T}_{f,c_1} &  &   \\\\\n         &  \\ddots &  \\\\\n        &   & \\mathbf{T}^{\\rm T}_{f,c_N}  \\\\\n        \\end{array}\\right]\\left(\\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{{f}}_{c_1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{{f}}_{c_N}\\end{array}\\right)\n\\]where \\(\\hat{\\square}\\) denotes the measured DoFs, and \\(\\mathbf{T}_{v,c_n}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{T}_{f,c_n}\\) are the response and force transformation matrices for the \\(n\\)th connection point. For the full multi-point interface mobility we then have, \\[\n    \\mathbf{Y}_{cc} =  \n        \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n        \\mathbf{T}_{v,c_1} &  &   \\\\\n         &  \\ddots &  \\\\\n        &   & \\mathbf{T}_{v,c_N}  \\\\\n        \\end{array}\\right]\n        \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n        \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_{c_1c_1} & \\cdots & \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_{c_1c_N}  \\\\\n        \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n        \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_{c_Nc_1} & \\cdots & \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_{c_Nc_N}\n        \\end{array}\\right]\n        \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n        \\mathbf{T}_{f,c_1} &   &   \\\\\n         &  \\ddots & \\\\\n        &  &  \\mathbf{T}_{f,c_N}\n        \\end{array}\\right]^{\\rm T}\n\\tag{16}\\] where it is noted that each transformation matrix can be constructed using the most appropriate method for that connection point (not necessarily the VPT).\nFinally, to include a set of additional remote DoFs \\(r\\) where no interface transformations are required, #eq-multipointInt can be extended simply as, \\[\n    \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n        \\mathbf{Y}_{cc} & \\mathbf{Y}_{cr}  \\\\\n        \\mathbf{Y}_{rc}  & \\mathbf{Y}_{rr}\n        \\end{array}\\right] =  \n        \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n        \\mathbf{T}_{v,c} &    \\\\\n        &  \\mathbf{I}\n        \\end{array}\\right]\n        \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n        \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_{cc} &  \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_{cr}  \\\\\n        \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_{rc} & \\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}_{rr}\n        \\end{array}\\right]\n        \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n        \\mathbf{T}_{f,c} &    \\\\\n        & \\mathbf{I}\n        \\end{array}\\right]^{\\rm T}\n\\tag{17}\\] where \\(c = \\{c_1, c_2, \\cdots, c_N\\}\\).",

    "text": "Flexible interfaces\nThe notion of a point interface is typically valid in the low-mid frequency range. Fortunately, this is the range where most structural vibration problems are concerned, and so the point interface assumption has served the community well over the decades. However, new technologies (such as vehicle electrification) are ever extending the frequency of interest. With the corresponding wavelength decreasing, structural connections that might once have appeared `point-like’ are becoming comparable in size to wavelength. As a consequence, the assumption of locally rigid dynamics breaks down as local deformations occur. To deal with this, more complex representations of interface dynamics are required. Below we briefly detail a flexible extension of the virtual point transformation.\nThe virtual point transformation, as described above, relies on the construction of the so-called Interface Deformation Mode (IDM) matrices, \\(\\mathbf{R}_m\\) that describe how the measured DoF would respond to the motion of a virtual point, assuming rigid body motion. The rows of \\(\\mathbf{R}_m\\) correspond to the \\(x, y\\) and \\(z\\) coordinates of the measurement DoF, whilst the columns relate to the permissible motions of the virtual point (the translations, and three rotations), \\[\n\\mathbf{R}_m =  \\left[\\rule{0cm}{1.4cm}\\right.\\overbrace{\\begin{array}{ccc} 0 & 0 & 0  \\\\\n    0 & 1 & 0  \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 \\end{array}}^{\\mbox{Translation}}\n\\left|\\rule{0cm}{1.4cm}\\right.\\,\\,\\,\n\\overbrace{\\begin{array}{ccc  }  0 & r_z & -r_y \\\\\n    -r_z & 0 & r_x \\\\\n    r_y & -r_x & 0 \\end{array}}^{\\mbox{Rotation}}  \\,\\,\\,\\left.\\rule{0cm}{1.4cm}\\right].\n\\] Importantly, any residual motion (i.e. flexibility) not captured by the 6 VP DoFs is discarded and not included in the interface representation. To accommodate for flexibility of the interface, additional modes must be added to the IDM matrix. A `bottom-up’ definition of flexible interface behaviour is recommended, which avoids the need for a priori knowledge of the interface dynamics, and is therefore more generally applicable.\nThe following example is given of an extended virtual point IDM that is capable of capturing an additional three extension (i.e. ‘strain’) and torsion deformations, alongside the standard rigid modes, \\[\n        \\mathbf{R}_m^{ext} = \\left[\\rule{0cm}{1.4cm}\\right.\\overbrace{\\begin{array}{ccc} 0 & 0 & 0  \\\\\n    0 & 1 & 0  \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 \\end{array}}^{\\mbox{Translation}}\n\\left|\\rule{0cm}{1.4cm}\\right.\n\\,\\,\\,\n\\overbrace{\\begin{array}{ccc  }  0 & r_z & -r_y \\\\\n    -r_z & 0 & r_x \\\\\n    r_y & -r_x & 0 \\end{array}}^{\\mbox{Rotation}}\n\\left|\\rule{0cm}{1.4cm}\\right.\n\\,\\,\\,\n\\overbrace{\\begin{array}{ccc  }  r_x & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & r_y & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & r_z \\end{array}}^{\\mbox{Extension}}  \n\\left|\\rule{0cm}{1.4cm}\\right.\n\\,\\,\\,\n\\overbrace{\\begin{array}{ccc  }  0 & r_y r_z & -r_zr_y \\\\\n    -r_xr_z & 0 & r_zr_x\\\\\n     r_x r_y & -r_y r_x & 0 \\end{array}}^{\\mbox{Torsion}}\n    \\,\\,\\,\\left.\\rule{0cm}{1.4cm}\\right]\n\\] Based on this extended IDM matrix, a measured response is represented as, \\[\n    \\hat{v}_n = \\left[\\begin{array}{c} e_x \\\\ e_y \\\\ e_z \\end{array} \\right]^{\\rm T} \\mathbf{R}_n^{ext}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{v}_{tr.} \\\\ \\mathbf{v}_{rot.} \\\\ \\mathbf{v}_{ext.} \\\\ \\mathbf{v}_{tor.}\\end{array} \\right]\n\\tag{18}\\] where the flexible virtual point DoFs \\(\\mathbf{v}_{ext.} = [v_{ext.,x}, v_{ext.,y}, v_{ext.,z}]^{\\rm T}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}_{tor.} = [v_{tor.,x}, v_{tor.,y}, v_{tor.,z}]^{\\rm T}\\) have been added to the virtual point response vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). Note that a similar procedure can be applied to the excitation IDM matrix.\nHigher order flexible IDMs can be defined with similar ease, requiring only the product of measurement DoF coordinates. When including flexible IDMs, it is important to always ensure that the resultant matrix \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is full-rank, i.e. to capture say 6 flexible modes, a minimum ov total of 12 independent measurement DoFs are required; 6 for the rigid IDMs, and 6 force the flexible IDMs.\nIn practice, it is necessary to ‘cherry-pick’ the correct set of IDM modes for the problem at hand, whilst avoiding any unnecessary IDMs in the interface representation.",

    "text": "Equivalent multi-point connection\nOften when conducting a diagnostic test, such as in-situ TPA, interest does not lie with the contribution of the translational and rotational DoFs themselves, but rather with the contribution of the different connection points as a whole. In this case, there is no need to explicitly calculate the rotational DoFs, though their contribution must still be captured. This leads to the so-called (EMP) connection.\nThe equivalent multi-point connection is the most straightforward approach to capture rotational DoFs. The interface is instrumented/excited by 6 or more sensors/forces which, like the FD approximation, are attached/applied in spaced pairs. Each pair is orientated to point in a particular direction (\\(x\\), \\(y\\) or \\(z\\)). By measuring 6+ translational DoFs, all 6 DoFs (translations and rotations) are implicitly captured. Translational DoFs are encoded by the pair-wise average, whilst the rotational DoFs are encoded by the pair-wise difference, much like the FD approximation. Importantly however, the averaged translational and rotational components are not calculated explicitly; their influence is encoded within the 6+ individual translations. Hence we treat the connection as 6+ equivalent translational DoFs. Take for example the interface configuration in Figure \\(\\ref{FDexample2}\\) (right). Seven translational sensors are positioned around the interface. These are accompanied by 7 translational force excitations. According to the equivalent multi-point connection the mobility matrix \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{cc}\\) for this contact point would be of dimensions \\(7\\times 7\\). Rotational information about the \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) axes are encoded by the sensors spaced about their respective axes.\nMore generally, the sensors/applied forces do not have to be included as spaced pairs. So long as no two sensors/forces are co-located, and those that are included sufficiently span \\(x\\) \\(y\\) and \\(z\\), all translational and rotational interface motions will be captured.\nThe main advantages of the equivalent multi-point connection approach are its straight forward implementation and ability to capture rotational DoFs. Furthermore, in the case that $&gt;$6 measurement points are used, it has the ability to capture flexible interface dynamics. Its main disadvantage is that the true translational and rotational motions are not explicitly calculated. This can cause some issues when trying to combine data sets, for example measured blocked forces with transfer functions obtained from numerical models or other experimental set-ups.\nThough straight forward to implement, it is important to note that if more than 6 translations are used in the EMP representation, some regularisation may be required to avoid a rank deficient mobility matrix; if there are more sensors/forces present than DoFs to capture (i.e. more parameters than can be justified by the data) and the connection point indeed behaves rigidly, the inversion of \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{cc}\\) can become ill-conditioned and large errors returned. A simple solution is to perform a Singular Value Decomposition to invert the matrix, and retain only the first 6 singular values.",

    "text": "A short comment on interface completeness\nThe importance of accurately representing all the important interactions taking place at the interface has been emphasised in the above. For components with discrete point-like interfaces, these interactions are represented by the translational and rotational DoFs at each coupling point, all of which have the potential to contribute towards the dynamics of the assembled VAVP. At mid-to-high frequencies, where interface deformations become significant, higher order ‘flexible’ DoFs are required to provide an adequete description. An interface rpresentation description that is missing important DoFs can be said to be incomplete.\nThe incomplete representation of an interface is perhaps one of the main sources of error when building a VAVP. Not only does it effect the substructuring of components (if DoFs are not included in the interface model, then will not be coupled by the substructuring) but it can have a serve impact on the active characterisation of vibration sources (by neglecting DoFs large bias errors can be introduced onto the characterisation). It is therefore adventageous to develop tests for completeness, i.e. methods to identify whether the chosen interface representation has enough DoFs (also that these DoFs are the ‘right ones’). This topic is closely related to that of Uncertainty, and so it will be addressed in more detail there.",
